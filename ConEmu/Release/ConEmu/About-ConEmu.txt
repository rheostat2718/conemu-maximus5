ConEmu - Windows Console Emulator


About ConEmu

    ConEmu-Maximus5 is a Windows console emulator, which represents multiple
    consoles as one customizable GUI window with various features. Basic
    application - joint use with Far Manager (FAR in Wikipedia).
    Far (File and Archive) Manager is a console program for managing files and
    archives in Windows operating systems.

    This fork grew up from ConEmu by Zoin. 


Description

    ConEmu starts a console program in hidden console window and provides an
    alternative customizable GUI window with various features:
    * smooth window resizing;
    * several panels in one window;
    * tabs for editors, viewers, panels and consoles;
    * thumbnails and tiles in FAR manager;
    * normal, maximized and full screen window graphic modes;
    * window font anti-aliasing: standard, clear type, disabled;
    * window fonts: family, height, width, bold, italic, etc.; 
    * using normal/bold/italic fonts for different parts of console simultaneously;
    * cursor: standard console (horisontal) or GUI (vertical);
    * for /BufferHeight mode: vertical scrolling using keyboard;
    * show full output (1K+ lines) of last command in editor/viewer;
    * drag and drop (explorer style); 
    * and more, and more... take a look at Settings dialog, WhatsNew and Settings.reg 

    All settings are read from the registry or xml file (multiple
    configurations are supported) and after that the command line parameters
    are applied. Parameters /Config and /BufferHeight are only for command
    line. Most of settings are changed only in the Settings dialog, not from
    the command line.


Requirements
    Windows 2000 or later.


Installation
    1. Unpack all files (from appropriate "ConEmu.*.7z") to the folder,
       containing "far.exe".
       It's strongly recommended to use ConEmu.x64 on 64bit systems.
       Note, if You are not using FAR manager, You may unpack files to
       any folder.
    2. Import to the registry FAR manager macroses, related to ConEmu.
       Macro *.reg files are located in ConEmu.Addons directory.
       Each macro file (*.reg) has description in header.
       Just doubleclick choosen files in Windows Explorer to import them.
    3. By default (started without command line params), ConEmu runs "far.exe"
       from it's home folder. Alternatively, You may specify any root command,
       specifying "/Cmd <App with params>" argument in ConEmu shortcut or
       command line.


Command Line Syntax
	ConEmu [/CT] [/FS | /MAX] [/Font ..] [/Size ..] [/FontFile ..] [/Config ..]
	       [/Single] [/BufferHeight ..] [/Multi | /NoMulti] [/Cmd ..]

    Started without params, ConEmu runs "far.exe" from it's home folder.

Parameters
	/?
	Shows help screen.

	/CT
	ClearType anti-aliasing.

	/FS
	Full screen mode.

	/MAX
	Maximized window mode.

	/Font <fontname>
	Specifies the font name.

	/Size <fontsize>
	Specifies the font size.

	/FontFile <fontfilename> - Loads fonts from file. You may specify more
	than one font file. First of them (except /Font specified) become main
	font.

	/Config <configname>
	Tells to use an existing or create a new configuration with the specified
	name. Each configuration keeps its own individual data in the registry or
	xml file (ConEmu.xml).

	/Single
	New console will be started in new tab of existing ConEmu.

	/BufferHeight <height>
	Sets console buffer height and tells to use keys CtrlUp, CtrlDn, CtrlPgUp,
	CtrlPgDn for vertical scrolling. This mode should not be used for programs
	like FAR where buffer and window height are equal.

	/Multi
	Turn on MultiConsole feature (several consoles in one ConEmu window,
	'long console output' feature).

	/Cmd <commandline>
	/Cmd @<commandfile>
	This MUST be the LAST switch.
    The rest (<commandline>) is treated as a command to start and its
    parameters. By default ConEmu uses a command from saved configuration, if
    any, otherwise it tries to starts Far in normal mode or Cmd in
    /BufferHeight mode.
    You may use @<commandfile> instead of <commandline> to start several
    consoles simultaneously in one ConEmu instance.
    Sample startfile.txt:
      >"C:\Program Files\Far\far.exe"
      */BufferHeight 400 cmd
      /BufferHeight 1000 powershell


Command Line Examples
	ConEmu.exe /CT /Font "Lucida Console" /Size 16 /Cmd Far.exe "c:\1 2\"
	ConEmu.exe /Config ScrollMode /BufferHeight 9999 /Cmd PowerShell.exe
