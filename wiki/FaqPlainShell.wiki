#summary Run your shell naked

In some cases third party software or plugins may affect normal behaviour of your shell.
And that may be *not* a !ConEmu issue at all.

Most of shells have switches to disable loading plugins or extensions.
Just use them. Easiest way to use "ConEmu /cmd ..." to force proper shell command.
For example:
{{{
ConEmu /cmd PowerShell -noprofile
}}}
Alternatively, you may change the ‘Command line’ on the ‘Startup’ settings page.

==cmd==
Just run cmd using "/D" switch.
{{{
cmd /D
}}}

==!PowerShell==
Use "-noprofile" switch.
{{{
PowerShell -noprofile
}}}

==Far Manager==
Use "/p" to disable plugins and "/m" to disable macros.
{{{
Far /p /m
}}}
