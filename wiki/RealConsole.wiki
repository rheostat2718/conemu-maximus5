ConEmu always run standard Windows console - ‘Real console’, but it is hidden most of time.

Many users erroneously name it as `cmd.exe`, but it is not true.
Windows console window is a part of Windows kernel (`csrss.exe` up to Vista and `conhost.exe` in Windows 7 and higher).
And you may run there console applications: `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe` and many others are shells and tools.

If you need to take a look at ‘Real console’ just press (simultaneously) in the ConEmu window ‘Ctrl+Win+Alt+Space’.
Alternatively - SystemMenu -> Debug -> Real console.

Sometimes you may see flickering ‘Real console’ during ConEmu tab startup.
That is intended behavior for ‘Run as administrator’ and debugging using [DefaultTerminal Default terminal] feature.
