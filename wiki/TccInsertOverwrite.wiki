#summary Change tcc prompt to insert mode by default

From time to time any user complains that ConEmu starts tcc (tcc/le) prompt in ‘Overwrite’ mode.
But that is not a ConEmu responsibility (check it with `cmd.exe` as a shell).
You need to configure your tcc properly.

Just run from yours tcc prompt:

{{{
OPTION
}}}

And choose desired mode on the ‘Command Line’ tab. Do not forget to press ‘OK’ button ;)

Actually, it will update your `TCMD.INI` file (located in `"%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\JPSoft"` or near to `tcc.exe`).

{{{
[4NT]
CursorIns=15
CursorOver=100
EditMode=Insert
;; And so on...
}}}

Alternatively, you may use the following command in your tcc prompt.
But note that it will not update yours `TCC.INI` configuration file.

{{{
SETDOS /M1 /S100:15
}}}
