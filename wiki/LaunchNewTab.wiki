==[ConEmuArgs Using ConEmu switches]==
When you run something from `Win+R` or shortcut from your Desktop,
you may use `-cmd` or `-cmdlist` to run your application.
Remember, `-cmd` or `-cmdlist` will be the last ConEmu's GUI interpreted switch.
The rest of command line will be used to start your application.
Read more in the [ConEmuArgs wiki]. Example:

    ConEmu -reuse -dir "c:\projects" -cmd "set PATH=C:\MinGW\bin;%PATH%" & chcp 65001 & sh -l -i

==Create new console dialog==
How to start application (tcc, powershell, far, putty) in !ConEmu tab?

<img src="http://conemu-maximus5.googlecode.com/svn/files/ConEmuCreate.png" title="ConEmu confirmation of new console creation" alt="ConEmu new console">

This dialog may be opened from:
  * Keyboard (Win+W by default), or
  * <img src="http://conemu-maximus5.googlecode.com/svn/files/ConEmuAddBtn.png" title="Toolbar" alt="Toolbar">
  * <img src="http://conemu-maximus5.googlecode.com/svn/files/ConEmuAddSys.png" title="System menu" alt="System menu">

Well, what you can do with this dialog?
  * Choose command line and startup directory for new process. You may use environment variables in both fields. Also, you may choose from drop down list either any of predefined [Tasks tasks] or any command from history.
  * Choose another user name and password, ‘Restricted current user’ account or ‘Run as administrator’ feature.
  * You may split active tab vertically or horizontally (you need last alpha versions for this feature).
  * And it is possible to start new tab in the new !ConEmu window (new `ConEmu.exe` process will be started).
  * Dialog's system menu contains ‘Reset command history’ menu item.

Similar dialog may be opened when you [RestartTab ‘Restart current console’].

===Create new console without dialog===
You may switch off create new console confirmation, just disable ‘Create confirmation’ checkbox
on [Settings#Appearance Appearance] settings page.

*Note*. You may pop up confirmation dialog even if ‘Create confirmation’ unchecked.
Just hold Shift while creating console from toolbar, System menu, or Keyboard (Win+Shift+W by default).

==[Tasks Tasks]==
You may define your own tasks or just use predefined one.
Choose the task from drop down menu or run task by hotkey.
You may choose task in the ‘Create new console’ dialog too.

==Create new tab from existing one==
Use [NewConsole -new_console] switch while executing command.
For example, if you want to start PuTTY in new !ConEmu tab,
type in command prompt (cmd.exe started in !ConEmu tab)
{{{
putty -new_console
}}}
and it will be launched in the new tab of !ConEmu.

-new_console works even in batch files.

*Note*. Option ‘Inject !ConEmuHk’ must be turned on (Settings -> Features).

==Duplicate root==
Well, this interesting feature offers a way to duplicate shell (root process of current tab) state
to the new !ConEmu tab.
For example, you have started `cmd.exe`, set up environment variables, cd somewhere,
run any program (vim for example) and call ‘Duplicate root’ from tab popup menu. This will
create ‘copy’ of `cmd.exe` at most recent state (when possible).

==Default terminal feature==
This allows to seize creation of console processes from many (selected by user) applications.
For example, when you run ‘Command prompt’ shortcut from ‘Start menu’ cmd.exe may start in the new !ConEmu tab.
Read more about [DefaultTerminal Default terminal feature].

==Attach existing console or GUI application==
Choose ‘Attach...’ from [SystemMenu system menu].

==Attach from command prompt==
Batch file ‘Attach.cmd’ ships with !ConEmu package. Run this file from any cmd.exe to attach this console
into the new !ConEmu tab. This batch just run following command
{{{
ConEmuC.exe /ATTACH /NOCMD
}}}
which you may run from any other console shell or even from your own console application.

==Automatic attach of cmd==
Mostly like as ‘Attach from command prompt’ but you may set up automatic execution of ‘Attach’ on cmd.exe startup.
This also works with TCC/LE. Set up feature on ‘!ComSpec’ page of ‘Settings’ dialog.

==Gui Macro==
You may set up several most used shells or build environments via GuiMacro.
Example: open ‘Keys & Macro’ settings page, click ‘Macros’ radio (it filters long key list)
and in the free ‘Macro XX’ slot type
{{{
shell("","C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /E:ON /V:ON /T:0E /K ""C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.1\\Bin\\SetEnv.cmd"" /Release /x86")
}}}
choose any wanted hotkey (*Ctrl*+*Shift*+*1* for example) and *Save settings*.
