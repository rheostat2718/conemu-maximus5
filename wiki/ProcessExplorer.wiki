+AFs-http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653 Process Explorer+AF0- is handy and useful
tool which can show you all about running process in your Windows system.

For example, it can show all environment variables defined in selected
process - just open process properties and go to +ACI-Environment+ACI- tab.

Also, it can show all loaded dll-files in your process.

BTW, Far Manager plugin +ACI-Process list+ACI- can do same things.
