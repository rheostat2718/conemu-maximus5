[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653 Process Explorer] is handy and useful
tool which can show you all about running process in your Windows system.

For example, it can show all environment variables defined in selected
process - just open process properties and go to "Environment" tab.

Also, it can show all loaded dll-files in your process.

BTW, Far Manager plugin "Process list" can do same things.
