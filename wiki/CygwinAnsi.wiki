=Cygwin and pty related issues=
I have many reports about cygwin.
And most of them are related to one cygwin behavior:
when it detects real win32 console, it process all ANSI sequences internally,
so ConEmu does not receive ANSI at all.

Yep, users said: ‘It is working in mintty’.

Answer is simple: mintty is not a ‘real’ console, all its magic is done with pipes.

On the one hand - cygwin detects ‘pipe’ mode (that mode may be named ‘pty’ or ‘cygwin terminal’)
and do not process ANSI internally, but just bypass them to terminal.

On the other hand - many console applications fails in mintty (most known to me - PowerShell and Far Manager).

ConEmu is hybrid terminal.
It support all functionality Windows offers to console applications AND is able to process [http://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html ANSI sequences],
all magic is done by [ConEmuHk hooking Windows API].

But cygwin do not know about [http://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html ConEmu abilities] and I do not know any way to force cygwin to do ‘right’ things (send ANSI to !ConEmu consoles).

May be in future I'll find a way to combine pty and real console features, but at the moment, may be, better and faster way is request the ‘feature’ from cygwin developers.
