#summary Cygwin and pty related issues

I have many reports about cygwin. And most of them are related to one annoying cygwin behavior: It does NOT send ANSI sequences to ConEmu consoles.

Yep, users said: "It is working in mintty".

Answer is simple: mintty is not a 'real' console, all its magic is done with pipes. On the one hand - cygwin detects 'pipe' mode (sometimes that mode is named "pty") and don't process ANSI internally, but just bypass them to terminal. On the other hand - many console applications fails in mintty (most known to me - PowerShell and Far Manager).

ConEmu is hybrid terminal. It support all functionality Windows offers to console applications AND is able to process ANSI sequences.

But cygwin doesn't know about ConEmu abilities and I don't know any way to force cygwin to do "right" things (send ANSI to ConEmu consoles).

May be in future I'll find a way to combine pty and real console features, but at the moment, may be, better and faster way is request the "feature" from cygwin developers.
