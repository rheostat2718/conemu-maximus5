==Abstract==
Several times I've seen cygwin/msys errors when their subsystem had failed to create child processes.

===Example from cygwin's ls===
{{{
0 [main] us 0 init_cheap: VirtualAlloc pointer is null, Win32 error 487 AllocationBase 0x68520000, BaseAddress 0x68570000, RegionSize 0x218000, State 0x1000 C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\ls.exe: *** Couldn't reserve space for cygwin's heap, Win32 error 487
}}}

===Example from msys-git's perl===
{{{
С:\GIT\bin\perl.exe: *** unable to remap С:\GIT\bin\libsvn_wc-1-0.dll to same address as parent -- 0x2190000
1 [main] perl 8248 sync_with_child: child 5768(0xB60) died before initialization with status code 0x1
2 [main] perl 8248 sync_with_child: *** child state child loading dlls
C:\GIT\bin\perl.exe: *** unable to remap С:\GIT\lib\perl5\site_perl\5.8.8\msys\auto\SVN\_Delta\_Delta.dll to same address as parent -- 0x630000
3 [main] perl 8248 sync_with_child: child 6632(0xB90) died before initialization with status code 0x6802752F
3 [main] perl 8248 sync_with_child: *** child state child loading dlls
}}}

==The problem==
Digging the problem for some time I've found the reason of these errors on my PC (in perl's case).

  * Address, where perl wants to load its libraries was used by `C:\Windows\System32\uxtheme.dll`.
  * This `uxtheme.dll` was loaded as static linked library by `C:\Windows\apppatch\AcGenral.dll`.
  * This `AcGenral.dll` was loaded (dynamically) by `C:\Windows\System32\apphelp.dll`.
  * And this `apphelp.dll` was loaded in the parent process of the `ConEmu.exe` (that was `USBSafelyRemove.exe` in my case).
  * Oops...
