#summary How to display bold/italic/underlined text in the console

ConEmu provides full-featured support of Windows console functions.
That means you may run here any console applications designed for WinApi.
On the other hand, Windows console does not provide official way to
print bold/italic/underlined text.

However, when you are using ConEmu you may use them. Here are some tricks.

You may choose two background color indexes to force ConEmu to draw text using bold/italic outline.

When you turn the feature *On* on the ‘Main’ page, by default,
‘Light red’ background will be replaced with bold outlined text,
and ‘Magenta’ background will be replaced with italic outlined text.

Example for ‘cmd.exe’ prompt: bold ‘path’ followed by italic ‘time’ and normal ‘>’.
{{{
prompt $E[37;4;41m$P$E[m$S$E[37;4;45m$T$E[m$G
}}}

The drawback. You lose two background indexes and you must choose the background color
they would replaced with. In the following examples, black color (`#0`) was selected
for using with `cmd.exe` prompt.
