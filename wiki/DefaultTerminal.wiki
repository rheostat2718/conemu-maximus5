#summary How to change the default terminal emulator on Windows

=!ConEmu has moved to conemu.github.io=
New versions of this file are available on [http://conemu.github.io/en/DefaultTerminal.html conemu.github.io].

Google has declared [http://google-opensource.blogspot.ru/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html shutdown] of googlecode service. 

=Introduction=

In fact, Windows does not provide official way to change default terminal application.
That is because console subsystem is a part of Windows kernel (`csrss.exe` up to Vista and `conhost.exe` in Windows 7 and higher).

Only use of hacking methods can ‘change’ default Windows terminal application. And ConEmu can do it!

*WARNING*! Enabling ‘Default terminal’ feature may cause false alarms in some antiviral programs!

!ConEmu build 121124 introduced unique feature: ‘Replace default Windows terminal’.

=Description=

<img src="http://conemu-maximus5.googlecode.com/svn/files/Settings-DefTerm.png" title="ConEmu settings, DefTerm page" alt="ConEmu settings, DefTerm page">

Just turn on checkbox ‘Force !ConEmu as default terminal for console applications’,
optionally turn on checkbox ‘Register on OS startup’
and point ‘parent’ applications from you like to start console tools (for example `explorer.exe|devenv.exe|totalcmd.exe`)
and voila. You may press *Win*+*R* type `ipconfig /all` and press *Enter*.
It will starts in the new !ConEmu tab.

When you run console application from specified ‘parent’ application,
your console application will be started in the new !ConEmu tab.

The only exception - consoles started ‘As administrator’ can't be hooked yet.

*Note*! To ensure that your console application will be seized, run ConEmu *before*
starting your consoles or debugging processes (from Visual Studio for example).
However, that may be not required if you choose ‘Register on OS startup’.
But in fact, ‘registering’ will affect, in most cases, only `explorer.exe` ‘parent’ process.
So, recommendation is ‘run ConEmu before...’

‘[SettingsDefTerm Default terminal]’ feature is more powerful than
‘Automatic attach of cmd’ (‘[SettingsComspec ComSpec]’ page).
‘Default terminal’ can seize starting of *any* console program, not only cmd.exe.
For example, you may dblclick on `ipconfig.exe` in Total Commander panel and voila...
Also there will be no flickering of real console window.

=Tech info=

The only real way to ‘change’ default Windows terminal:

  * Hide RealConsole when your console application is to be started;
  * Run new ConEmu window if no one instance was running before;
  * Attach started console application into ConEmu instance.

Looks simple, right? But who can perform these actions?

==Hooks must be installed==

ConEmuHk (`ConEmuHk.dll` or `ConEmuHk64.dll`) must be loaded into process space of
‘parent’ application *from* which you are starting new console application:
Explorer (explorer.exe), Task manager (taskmgr.exe), Visual Studio (devenv.exe or WDExpress.exe), and so on...

When ConEmuHk is loaded into ‘parent’ application it will hook limited set of Windows API functions
related to creating new processes. So, when you start console application from shortcut, *Win*+*R* or even from
Visual Studio debugger, ConEmuHk will change application startup procedure to the described above.

Actually, startup procedure slightly differs when you start debugging session.

==Normal console application startup==

To avoid flickering of RealConsole window ConEmuHk will change command line.

When you run "cmd" from *Win*+*R* and no ConEmu instance was runned:
{{{
ConEmu.exe /single /cmd -new_console:n "C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe" 
}}}

And when ConEmu window already exists:
{{{
ConEmuC64.exe [many internal switched] /HIDE /NOCONFIRM /ROOT "C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe" 
}}}

That is safe because ‘parent’ does not really need to get started process handle (`cmd.exe` in example).

==Starting debugging session==

When you start Visual Studio debugger of your ‘`ConAppSample`’, ‘parent’ process
(devenv.exe or WDExpress.exe) need to get the handle of your ‘`ConAppSample.exe`’
to be able to call debugging routines.

That is why RealConsole window will flickers on screen before alternative attach procedure completes.

Note, when you are debugging .Net console application, Visual Studio will run ‘`ConAppSample.vshost.exe`’,
if option ‘Enable the Visual Studio hosting process’ is checked in your project Properties\Debug.
