==Mouse options==

*Send mouse events to console* Uncheck this to stop sending mouse events to console, mouse will be processed by ConEmu internally (text selection, for example)

*Skip click on activation* Skip mouse button (left/right/middle) click, while activating window

*Skip in background* Skip mouse move events, while ConEmu is not foreground window



==Intercept keys==

*Install keyboard hooks* Allows interception of Win+Number, Win+Arrows, Alt+Esc, Alt+Tab, etc.

*Win+Tab - switch consoles (Tabs)* Disable Windows 7 Aero switch (Win+Tab) when ConEmu in foreground

*Win+Numbers - activate console* Enables switching of tabs (30 consoles) by their numbers (1,2,...,9,10,11,...). ‘Host-key’ is ‘Win’ key, by default.

*Win+Arrows - resize window* Resize ConEmu window with arrow keys



==Seize keys / Send to console==

*Alt+Tab* When checked, You can use "Alt+Tab" in Far internally. Warning! This blocks ability of switching to another window

*Alt+Esc* When checked, You can use "Alt+Esc" in Far internally

*Ctrl+Esc* When checked, You can use "Ctrl+Esc" in Far internally

*PrntScrn* When checked, You can use "PrintScrn" in Far internally

*Alt+PrScrn* When checked, You can use "Alt+PrintScrn" in Far internally



==Miscellaneous==

*Fix Alt on AltTab/AltF9 (to avoid execution of Far Manager macro, linked to Alt-release)* When You set a macro on Alt (RAlt) it can unexpectedly activates on AltTab or AltF9. This issue can be fixed by sending to console Control depress before Alt release.

*Skip focus events (don't send to console FOCUS_EVENT, useful with Far Manager)* Don't send focus events to console to disable autoclosing of fast search dialog in panels



==Read line enhancements (command prompt, ReadConsoleW)==

*Change prompt (cmd, powershell) text cursor position with Left Click* 3rd-state means ‘try to detect if console is in ReadConsole’, if you want to use this with bash - turn checkbox to ‘On’ (don't use third state)



*Delete word leftward to the cursor (default Ctrl+BackSpace)* Delete word leftward to the cursor (does not work in Far), 3rd-state means ‘try to detect if console is in ReadConsole’, if you want to use this with bash - turn checkbox to ‘On’ (don't use third state)
