#summary ConEmu log files

===Why they are needed===

When user reports a problem, frequently, developer needs more information than user may tell. ConEmu may write internal information in text form into log files.

===How to start logging===

Run `ConEmu.exe` or `ConEmu64.exe` (whatever you are using) with special switch `/log`. How to do that? Simpliest way is to press *Win+R*, type (or browse) in edit field full path to `ConEmu.exe` or `ConEmu64.exe` and append `/log` switch. There are also `/log2`, `/log3` and `/log4` alternatives. Larger digit - more information will be written - ConEmu will run slower.

===Where log files are created===

This depends of when program folder is write-allowed. For example, running as normal user any program can't write to `C:\Program Files`.

*If program folder is locked*, ConEmu will create on your desktop new folder named *ConEmuLogs* and write information to `ConEmu*.log` files there.

*If program folder is write-allowed*, ConEmu will create `ConEmu*.log` files near to executable file. Note, that there are `ConEmuC.exe` and `ConEmuC64.exe` in the `ConEmu` subfolder.
