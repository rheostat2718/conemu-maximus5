====Drag-n-Drop====
You may use dragging either with left or right mouse button.

On the [Settings#Features Features] page You may choose modifier (i.e. LeftCtrl or RightAlt)
for each mouse button, which allows drag starting. Also, You may disable Right or Left (or both)
button drag.

Right button default behavoiur is to create link, Left button - copy.

Behaviour can be changed holding Ctrl, Shift, or Alt when You drop items to the target.

Drop to command line:
  * Simple drop: paste full file or folder paths, space separated, autoquoted.
  * Ctrl: paste with «edit:» prefix
  * Alt: paste with «goto:» prefix
  * Shift: paste with «view:» prefix


====Right click on Far Manager panels====
You may choose right click behaviour:

  * Simple send right click to console;
  * Show context menu (via EMenu plugin);
  * Short click means simple right click, long click (depress, wait a while, release) means context menu.

*Note*. _EMenu_ plugin must be installed in FAR manager. No macroses or hotkeys are required, but You may choose different way to display context menu, by specifying the macro in !ConEmu settings.
