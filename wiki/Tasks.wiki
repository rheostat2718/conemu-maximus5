#summary Tasks in ConEmu

The ‘Task’ is one or more (tabbed or splitted) predefined commands (shells) which you may start anytime by name or hotkey.

Tasks may be configured in the [SettingsTasks ‘Settings’ dialog].

==Creating new task==
When you want to create new task absent in the default tasks list you need to know:

  * The shell name. For example: cmd, powershell, bash and so on.
  * The shell arguments. For example: `"/k vcvarsall.bat x86"
  * Shell working directory. That may be very significant.
  * In some cases you need to know environment variables.

===Where you may get this information?===
In most cases you may open properties of shortcut created by any installer.
Just find the shortcut, right-click it, and choose ‘Properties’.

  * Copy ‘Target’ contents to the ‘Task Commands’;
  * Optionally set working directory with `/dir` switch in the ‘Task parameters’;
  * If you want to choose specific tab name use [NewConsole -new_console:t:"VS 12.0"] switch;
  * Finally, if you need to define some environment variables, just specify them before the shell.
{{{
set Var1=Value1 & set "Var2=Value with spaces" & cmd /k vcvarsall.bat x86 -new_console:t:"VS 12.0"
}}}

Finally, the task for VS prompt is ready.

===If there is no shortcut for that shell===
Sometimes, if the shell is started from another program
you may use ProcessExplorer or ProcessMonitor to detect
which command is started, arguments and the working directory.

If you can't do that, just google for alternatives.
For example it is hard to find proper arguments for
NuGet console started from Visual Studio because VS
do not start `powershell.exe` but run powershell host
internally. Just google! For example:

  * [http://headsigned.com/article/using-nuget-standalone-command-line Using NuGet standalone command-line];
  * [http://stackoverflow.com/a/13581202/1405560 Download Nuget Packages Without VS/NuGet Package Manager];
  * [http://stackoverflow.com/a/15000559/1405560 Do an offline installation into Visual Studio].
