=List of environment variables set by !ConEmu=
|| *Name* || *Example* || *Description* ||
|| `ConEmuDir` || `C:\ConEmu` || folder, containing !ConEmu.exe ||
|| `ConEmuDrive` || `C:` || drive letter with colon, containing ConEmu.exe ||
|| `ConEmuBaseDir` || `C:\ConEmu\ConEmu` || folder, containing ConEmuC.exe ||
|| `ConEmuWorkDir` || `C:\Users` || folder, from where your shell was started ||
|| `ConEmuWorkDrive` || `C:` || drive letter with colon, from where your shell was started ||
|| `ConEmuArgs` || _vary_ || arguments were specified to !ConEmu.exe ||
|| `ConEmuConfig` || _vary_ || current configuration name, see `/config` switch ||
|| `ConEmuBuild` ||  `141126c` || current !ConEmu build number ||
|| `ConEmuPID` || _number_ || PID (process ID) of !ConEmu GUI ||
|| `ConEmuServerPID` || _number_ || PID (process ID) of !ConEmuC server executable ||
|| `ConEmuHWND` || `0x8HEXDGTS` || main !ConEmu window handle ||
|| `ConEmuDrawHWND` || `0x8HEXDGTS` || virtual console window handle (child window of !ConEmu), this is canvas for console text painting ||
|| `ConEmuBackHWND` || `0x8HEXDGTS` || backing for canvas, it may be larger than canvas if padding or scrollbars exists ||
|| `ConEmuIsAdmin` ||  `ADMIN` or not defined || set for those tabs/splits which were started elevated (UAC) ||
|| `ConEmuANSI` || `ON` or `OFF` || set by !ConEmu to `ON` when ‘ANSI X3.64’ is enabled ||
|| [ConEmuEnvironment#Disabling_hooks_temporarily ConEmuHooks] || `Enabled`|`OFF`|`NOARG`|`NOSTART` || you may temporarily disable injects when running ‘long’ batches or initialization scripts ||
|| [ConEmuEnvironment#Cheating_system_time ConEmuFakeDT] || `2014-12-31` || will cheat system and local current time for console processes ||
|| [GuiMacro#Far3-pre-Lua ConEmuMacroResult] || _vary_ || may be set only by !ConEmu's Far Manager plugin after executing [GuiMacro GUI Macro] ||

Also, there is an option ‘Add %!ConEmuBaseDir% to %PATH%’ on settings page ‘!ComSpec’. It is turned on by default
and allows to easily run executables and scripts from `%ConEmuBaseDir%` folder. For example:
{{{
ConEmuC /EXPORT PATH

or

csudo dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFX3 /All /Source:D:\sources\sxs /LimitAccess
}}}


=Debug purposed variables=
|| *Name* || *Description* || *Example* ||
|| `ConEmuSleepIndicator` || turning on monitoring feature of ‘Sleep in background’, when `ConEmuSleepIndicator=NUM` !ConEmu will turn off !NumLock when going sleep and turn on !NumLock when full active back || `NUM` or `OFF` ||
|| `ConEmuReportExe` || show message box like ‘hi.exe loaded’ when `hi.exe` started inside ConEmu tab; option ‘Inject ConEmuHk’ must be enabled || `hi.exe` ||


=Export variables=
When you start new console - it inherits environment strings (`%PATH%` also) from parent process (!ConEmu GUI).

When you change %PATH% in your shell - it applies to this shell and its children processes (that is started in current console/tab).

If you need to fixate this temporarily environment changes - you may execute
{{{
ConEmuC /export PATH
}}}

This will ‘copy’ your current `%PATH%` value to !ConEmu GUI and it will be applied to all new !ConEmu's consoles.

==Full syntax of Export command==
{{{
ConEmuC /EXPORT[=CON|ALL] [Var1 [Var2 [...]]]
ConEmuC /export[=CON|ALL] [Var1 [Var2 [...]]]
  VarN        - may contains one trailing/middle asterisk (sort of filemask support).
  /export     - export to all processes of current console and ConEmu GUI
  /export=CON - export to all processes of current console only
  /export=ALL - export to all processes of opened tabs and ConEmu GUI
}}}

  * Note! ‘Inject !ConEmuHk’ required to set variables.
  * Some shells may ignores environment changes by `/EXPORT=ALL` because of their features.
  * Shells comments
    * ‘Far Manager’ & ‘TCC/LE’ - OK;
    * ‘cmd’ - fails partially (required to run smth from active cmd, for example "cmd /k exit", to ‘apply’ changes);
    * ‘bash’ - fails completely (seems, it does not support outside changing of env.vars).


=Disabling hooks temporarily=
You may temporarily disable injects when running ‘long’ batches or initialization scripts:
{{{
cmd /k set ConEmuHooks=OFF & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" -new_console:sV -new_console:t:SDK & set ConEmuHooks=
}}}
Actually, `ConEmuHooks` may be set of ‘`OFF`’,‘`NOARG`’,‘`NOSTART`’ or simple ‘`Enabled`’. So if you want temporarily disable
processing of `-new_console` and `start` (which both are forcing command into the new [Tabs ConEmu tab])
you may set the following:
{{{
set ConEmuHooks=NOARG,NOSTART
}}}

=Cheating system time=
Environment variable "ConEmuFakeDT". That will cheat system and local current time for console processes.
Use carefully! Console applications will think that time was freezed! ‘Inject ConEmuHk’ must be on!
Some examples (cmd):
{{{
set ConEmuFakeDT=%DATE% %TIME%
set ConEmuFakeDT=2013-12-31T23:59:59.99
set ConEmuFakeDT=2013-01-31 9:0:0
set ConEmuFakeDT=2013-11-30
}}}
