=!ConEmu road map=

Any help will be very much appreciated

==Documentation==
Unfortunately, I don't have enough time for maintaning documentation and screenshots.
Also, my english is not very well :)

==Optimization==
Some portions of code must be optimized or totally rewritten :(

==Tab groups and themes==
Issue 294, Issue 194.

==Advertising==
I hope, !ConEmu is stable enough and competitive with other console emulators.

==Virtual console buffer==
In the current version, maximum buffer height (output history) is limited with 9999 lines (Windows console limit).

I want to eliminate this limitation :)

Also, restricting real console buffer to visible rect only greatly increase speed of command execution
(e.g. «`dir /s c:\windows`»).

==Horizontal scrolling==
Some programs use not only vertical, but horizontal console buffer. I think, support of it will be useful.

==Far Manager related==
===Icons in standard Far panels===
Thumbnails and Tiles already works, but they are !ConEmu windows which overlaps standard panels.
