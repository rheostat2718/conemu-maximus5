Any help will be very much appreciated

==Documentation==
Unfortunately, I don't have enough time for maintaning documentation and screenshots.
Also, my english is not very well :)

==Optimization==
Some portions of code must be optimized or totally rewritten :(

==Portable registry==
!ConEmu can store itself settings in xml file already.
However, it is possible to hook registry functions, so any (console or GUI) application,
started in !ConEmu tab become portable.

This portion of code exists but not perfect. So, it is disable in release versions.

==Tab groups and themes==
Issue 294, Issue 194.

==Advertising==
I hope, !ConEmu is stable enough and competitive with other console emulators.

==Virtual console buffer==
In the current version, maximum buffer height (output history) is limited with 9999 lines (Windows console limit).

I want to eliminate this limitation :)

Also, restricting real console buffer to visible rect only greatly increase speed of command execution
(e.g. «`dir /s c:\windows`»).

==Horizontal scrolling==
Some programs use not only vertical, but horizontal console buffer. I think, support of it will be useful.

==Far Manager related==
===Icons in standard Far panels===
Thumbnails and Tiles already works, but they are !ConEmu windows which overlaps standard panels.
