<font size="5"><b>Far Manager</b></font>

Far is my favorite shell. It is not only file/archive management,
it is powerful editor, huge number of plugins, powerful macro engine.

=First of all=

==There are two platforms (?)==
  * x86 (32-bit binaries) it works everywhere, beginning from Windows 2000 SP4 with one hotfix.
  * x64 (64-bit binaries) it requires 64-bit OS.
  
And yes, plugins compiled for x86 does not works in x64 Far Manager and vice versa. You owe to use appropriate plugin versions.

This is the general mistake of new users. They install x64 Far Manager and try to use x86 versions of plugins.
So, they asks «Why plugin does not appears in the list?»

IMHO, there is no considerable difference between them, but not every plugin has x64 version.

I'm using Far 3.0 x86 version (my primary OS is Win 7 x64).

==There are three (already) branches of Far Manager==
  * 1.x (closed) oldschool version. It is ANSI (OEM to be more precise),
so it can't deal with unicode characters out of system OEM codetable.
However, some users believe «the best the enemy of good» and do not switch to newer versions.
All settings are stored in registry `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far`.
  * 2.x (closed). General difference - unicode support (file system, editor, viewer).
There was API break, but 2.x natively supports most of 1.x plugins via internal plugin wrapper.
All settings are stored in registry `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far2`.
  * 3.x (curren). General difference - Far Manager settings and native (3.x) plugins settings are stored in SQLiteDB.
API was completely redesigned (and not stable for current day). Many bugfixes and improvements.
Far 3.x can still deal with ANSI plugins (from Far 1.x),
but due to API break can't work with «old» unicode plugins (from Far 2.x).
However! There is [http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/Far3Wrapper external plugin wrapper].
Through it you can use many plugins from Far 2.x.
