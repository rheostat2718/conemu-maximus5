!DirSync is a plugin for FAR Manager that allows a user to synchronize the contents of two directories, much like "Synchronize Folders" function of Total Commander. It is heavily based on Advanced Compare plugin that comes with FAR, with several improvements:

- A progress is displayed for "compare by content" (useful if you compare large files on slow media, e.g. when verifying contents of DVDs)

- After a comparison is finished, a new editor is opened with a list of found differences. This is quite useful even if you don't intend to do a synchronization, because - unlike Advanced Compare - it will display specific differences in subdirectories (A.C. only tells you that there is SOME difference SOMEWHERE in a subdirectory, but not what difference it is).

- You can edit the list of differences using all the power of FAR editor, including custom plugins such as Regular Expression Search and Replace.

- When the editor is closed, the plugin offers the synchronization. You can choose "copy to left" and "copy to right", with "confirm overwrite" for each direction, or ESCape the dialog and perform no synchronization. Only lines that remained in the list at the time it was last saved will be processed.
