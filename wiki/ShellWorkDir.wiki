#summary Current vs Startup directory

=About directories=

When you run new console the shell is starting in the directory you specified.
That is the ‘Startup directory’.

When you work with shell and do some CD's or run your scripts,
its ‘Current directory’ may be (and will) changed. But directory
is changed inside your [TerminalVsShell Shell] but not inside terminal.
!ConEmu does not handle your shell commands when your execute them.
Moreover, some shells (!PowerShell, bash, etc.) doesn't even call
Window API function ‘!SetCurrentDirectory’, they handle their
working directories internally.

However, since !ConEmu's build 140818 you get full support of ‘Current directory’ (*CD*).

  * Automatic detection of *CD* in `cmd.exe` or `tcc.exe`;
  * Ability to inform !ConEmu GUI about shell *CD* using [AnsiEscapeCodes ANSI] or [ConEmuC ConEmuC];
  * Display *CD* in the tab title using [SettingsTabBar tab templates];
  * Reuse *CD* in the [RestartTab Restart] and [LaunchNewTab Create new console] dialogs;
  * At last you may use "*%CD%*" variable with [GuiMacro#List_of_functions Shell] macro function in the `Dir` parameter.

=What you shall do to get *CD* support=

==cmd and tcc==
Just enable ‘[ConEmuHk Inject ConEmuHk]’ feature. !ConEmu will maintain *CD* for you automatically.

==bash and other cygwin shells==
You need to tell bash to run `"ConEmuC -StoreCWD"` command each time its prompt executed.
For example, add to your `.bashrc`
{{{
PROMPT_COMMAND='ConEmuC -StoreCWD'
}}}

==!PowerShell==
You need to modify your profile to override prompt function. Just run in your PowerShell prompt:
{{{
notepad $Profile
}}}
And change prompt as in the following example:
{{{
function prompt {
  # Just prettify the prompt
  Write-Host -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Cyan "PS "
  $dir = $(get-location).ProviderPath
  Write-Host -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Yellow $dir
  # You may use ANSI or direct ConEmuC call
  # Write-Host -NoNewline (([char]27) + "]9;9;`"" + $dir + "`"" + ([char]27) + "\")
  & ConEmuC -StoreCWD "$dir"
  return ">"
}
}}}
