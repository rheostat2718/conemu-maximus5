==Description==
!ConEmu starts a console program in hidden console window and provides an alternative customizable GUI window with various features:

  * smooth window resizing;
  * several panels in one window;
  * tabs for editors, viewers, panels and consoles;
  * thumbnails and tiles in Far manager;
  * normal, maximized and full screen window graphic modes;
  * window font anti-aliasing: standard, clear type, disabled;
  * window fonts: family, height, width, bold, italic, etc.;
  * using [http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=153 normal/bold/italic] fonts for different parts of console simultaneously;
  * cursor: standard console (horisontal) or GUI (vertical);
  * for /!BufferHeight mode: vertical scrolling using keyboard;
  * show full output (1K+ lines) of last command in editor/viewer;
  * drag and drop (explorer style);
  * and more, and more... take a look at Settings dialog, !WhatsNew and Settings.reg

All settings are read from the registry (multiple configurations are supported) and
after that the command line parameters are applied. Parameters /Config and
/!BufferHeight are only for command line. Most of settings are changed only in
the Settings dialog, not from the command line.


==Requirements==
  * Windows 2000 or later.


==Installation==
  #. Unpack all files (from appropriate "`ConEmu.*.7z`") to the folder, containing "`far.exe`", or install "`ConEmu.*.msi`" package.
    * Note, if You are not using FAR manager, You may unpack files to any folder.
  #. Import to the registry FAR manager macroses, related to !ConEmu. Macro `*.reg` files are located in `ConEmu.Addons` directory. Each macro file (`*.reg`) has description in header. Just doubleclick choosen files in Windows Explorer to import them.
  #. By default (started without command line params), !ConEmu runs "`far.exe`" from it's home folder. Alternatively, You may specify any root command, specifying "/Cmd <App with params>" argument in !ConEmu shortcut or command line.
