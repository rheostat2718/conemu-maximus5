#summary Old builds may contain already fixed problems

=Update your installation=
If you are using old build, there is big chance that your problem was
fixed already. Why not to update?

Note, if you are using third-party bundles (like cmder or chocolatey)
you may not using latest build. There is ConEmu *internal* updater.
Just call it from SystemMenu \ Help \ Check for updates.
Or visit download page at [http://www.fosshub.com/ConEmu.html FossHub].

Also, thanks to googlecode for stopping Download service, if you are using
*very old build* (pre 140115) can be *automatically* updated in *two steps* only.

==Version check==
!ConEmu version is visible in the status bar, Settings or About dialogs.
Just press `Win+Alt+A` to be sure (SystemMenu \ Help \ About).
