  * Issue 248 : Added ability to save / load custom color palette. Ð¡olor palette contains 32 (16+16) colors and setting 'Extend foreground colors'. Named palettes are stored in the "Colors" subkey of reg/xml settings.
  * Issue 445 : Added ability to create custom 'Tasks'. In fact, this is an alias to run one or more applications in new tabs !ConEmu. May be configured in 'Tasks' page of 'Settings' dialog, and stored in "Tasks" subkey subkey of reg/xml settings. 'Task' may be used (for example of the {Shells}):
    * when you start by specifying the properties of the shortcut: "!ConEmu.exe / cmd {Shells}";
    * specifying {Shells} in the 'Command line' page 'Main' of 'Settings' dialog;
    * when you create a new console interface !ConEmu (`+` on the toolbar, a list of Recreate-dialog);
    * from the command line (cmd.exe): "%!ConEmuBaseDir%\ConEmuC.exe" / c {Shells} -new_console.
    * from the command line (far.exe): conemu:run:{Shells} -new_console 
  * Minor fix in debug switch "/ detached".
  * Vista+: When the console is set detache acceptable to the user font size.
