  * Internal interprocess communication changes.
  * Windows 7 or higher. Jump list support: !ConEmu may add its 'Predefined tasks' and commands from its history into the Windows 'Tasks' section. Jump list population takes some time, therefore the button 'Update Now!' was added to the 'Tasks' page of the 'Settings' dialog.
  * !ConEmu.exe: Added command line argument /title "Template". The specified text will be shown in !ConEmu's window title instead of the active console's title. You may use environment variables in the "Template" string.

  * Win+H: Make screenshot of active !ConEmu window.

==Build 120527a==
  * Window mode changes (Normal/Maximized/Full screen) was not saved, if button 'Apply' was not clicked before 'Save settings'.
  * Fixed Status bar setup menu hints.


==Build 120527==
  * Current accelerators are shown in system and tab menu.
  * Mouse events was not sent to console apps (except Far), when scrolling is on.
  * 'Settings' -> 'Features' -> 'Mouse options' -> 'Enable mouse'. Enabled by default. May be disabled to forbid sending mouse event to console. However, when disabled, you still can use mouse for selecting and pasting text.
  * New transparency option - !ColorKey. However, '!UserScreen transparency' is still more useful for Far Manager.
  * Win+G - new hotkey for 'Attach...' system menu item.
  * Status Bar. Enabled by default. Font, color and column list (any of 20-th) are configurable in 'Settings' -> 'Status bar'. You may show/hide column from status bar popup menu, too. Column descriptions displayed, while hover mouse over it. Some columns process left clicks:
    * columns 'CAPS'/'NUM'/'SCRL' - switching;
    * column 'Active VCon' - active console selection popup menu (same as from toolbar);

==Build 120523==
  * 'Auto scroll' item removed from the system menu. If the console must be paused - use - Win+A (alternative buffer).
  * Ctrl+Win+Alt+Enter - forced activation of !ConEmu in !FullScreen. Like Win+C, the configurable hotkey will work regardless of the active application.
  * Win+Shift+Del - Terminate the active process in the current console.
  * The "ConEmuANSI" environment variable was added. Possible values are "ON" and "OFF".
  * Issue 554: Cursor positioning and text output errors (ANSI X3.64).
  * Issue 553: Console scrolling rollback.


==Build 120522==
  * New option: «[AnsiEscapeCodes ANSI X3.64 / 256color]» («Features» tab). The entire console's area is used (incl. scroll buffer), however Xterm 256color only applies to the "working" area (lowest part of the console, when using the scroll buffer). The option "Inject !ConEmuHk" must be enabled as well. If 256color does not seem to work, enable the «Colorer !TrueMod support» flag, and check that buffer/scrolling is disabled. Example: "`256colors2.pl -cur_console:h0`". Or, to scroll the console to the bottom: "`echo ^[[9999;1H`" (replace «^[» with the real ESC symbol (char with code \x1B)). Two examples are included in `ConEmu\Addons\AnsiColors16.ans` and `ConEmu\Addons\AnsiColors256.ans`.
  * Win+A - alternative buffer (toolbar button - black square). When used in Far Manager, it displays the output of the last command. Otherwise, freezes the current state of the console (incl. scroll buffer). The alternative console can be closed by a repeated Win+A or Esc.
  * Win+S - enable/disable scroll buffer (!BufferHeight). Ignored in Win7. Toolbar button - vertical arrows.
  * Win+N - Show create new console popup menu.
  * Issue 551: Updater, Invalid unpack command line, while using environment variables.
  * New !ConEmu.exe command-line options:
{{{
    /min - run minimized;
    /tsa - minimize to tray (to minimize to TSA on start, use with /min);
    /icon "<file>" - use icon from <file> (<file> can be exe, dll or ico);
    /noupdate - disable automatic update check on start.
}}}
  * 'About' dialog updated.
  * Fixed exception when lowering font size in Maximized window mode.
  * Added three system palettes: Standard VGA, Terminal.app, xterm.
  * Injects fixes.
