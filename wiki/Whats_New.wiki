    * There is new !ConEmu.exe switch "/nodefterm" - don't start initialization procedure.
  * Issue 825: ANSI X3.64 sequences don't works with Gow ls.

{{{
gvim --windowid !ConEmuBackHWND! -new_console:sH
}}}


==Build 121106==
  * New ConEmuC command: Export environment variables to parent processes. Syntax (case insensitive):

    * Также, добавлен пункт в системном меню !ConEmu: Debug -> Active process memory dump.
  * Tasks: `/DIR "<dir>"` учитывается при запуске вкладки в уже открытом !ConEmu.
  * Также, рабочую папку можно указать с помощью параметров "`-new_console:d[:<dir>]`" и "`-cur_console:d[:<dir>]`".

All my attempts to post comments and contact the article author were ignored :(

  * Internal interprocess communication changes.
  * Status bar: New column '!ConEmu GUI PID'.
  * Issue 566: Hotkey `<<None>>` is not unique.
  * 'Settings'-> 'Tasks' -> '!ConEmu arguments for Jump list'. You may specify here additional arguments for !ConEmu.exe, when starting from taskbar (Jump list). E.g.: `/icon "cmd.exe"`.


==Build 120602==
  * Internal interprocess communication changes.
  * Windows 7 or higher. Jump list support: !ConEmu may add its 'Predefined tasks' and commands from its history into the Windows 'Tasks' section. Jump list population takes some time, therefore the button 'Update Now!' was added to the 'Tasks' page of the 'Settings' dialog.
  * !ConEmu.exe: Added command line argument /title "Template". The specified text will be shown in !ConEmu's window title instead of the active console's title. You may use environment variables in the "Template" string.
  * 'Create new console' dialog: Added 'Reset command history...' item to the system menu.
  * Win+H: Make screenshot of active !ConEmu window.
  * Tabs: Separate tab templates for Panels (Far) and other console applications.

  * Take away lags while closing !ConEmu.
  * Sometimes, Shell-dialogs (starting files, EMenu items) does not appears in front of !ConEmu.
  * Minor change in (isMonitorConsoleLang == 2).

  * Changes in close tabs confirmation. Single dialog for all console, when closing !ConEmu by «clicking on the cross».


==Build 120527a==
  * Window mode changes (Normal/Maximized/Full screen) was not saved, if button 'Apply' was not clicked before 'Save settings'.
  * Fixed Status bar setup menu hints.


==Build 120527==
  * Current accelerators are shown in system and tab menu.
  * Mouse events was not sent to console apps (except Far), when scrolling is on.
  * 'Settings' -> 'Features' -> 'Mouse options' -> 'Enable mouse'. Enabled by default. May be disabled to forbid sending mouse event to console. However, when disabled, you still can use mouse for selecting and pasting text.
  * New transparency option - !ColorKey. However, '!UserScreen transparency' is still more useful for Far Manager.
  * Win+G - new hotkey for 'Attach...' system menu item.
  * Status Bar. Enabled by default. Font, color and column list (any of 20-th) are configurable in 'Settings' -> 'Status bar'. You may show/hide column from status bar popup menu, too. Column descriptions displayed, while hover mouse over it. Some columns process left clicks:
    * columns 'CAPS'/'NUM'/'SCRL' - switching;
    * column 'Active VCon' - active console selection popup menu (same as from toolbar);
    * column 'Transparency' - changing on the fly (100%..40%, !UserScreen, !ColorKey).

==Build 120523a==
  * Issue 554: Fixed handling of `^[#G` (ANSI X3.64).


==Build 120523==
  * 'Auto scroll' item removed from the system menu. If the console must be paused - use - Win+A (alternative buffer).
  * Ctrl+Win+Alt+Enter - forced activation of !ConEmu in !FullScreen. Like Win+C, the configurable hotkey will work regardless of the active application.
  * Win+Shift+Del - Terminate the active process in the current console.
  * The "ConEmuANSI" environment variable was added. Possible values are "ON" and "OFF".
  * Issue 554: Cursor positioning and text output errors (ANSI X3.64).
  * Issue 553: Console scrolling rollback.


==Build 120522==
  * New option: «[AnsiEscapeCodes ANSI X3.64 / 256color]» («Features» tab). The entire console's area is used (incl. scroll buffer), however Xterm 256color only applies to the "working" area (lowest part of the console, when using the scroll buffer). The option "Inject !ConEmuHk" must be enabled as well. If 256color does not seem to work, enable the «Colorer !TrueMod support» flag, and check that buffer/scrolling is disabled. Example: "`256colors2.pl -cur_console:h0`". Or, to scroll the console to the bottom: "`echo ^[[9999;1H`" (replace «^[» with the real ESC symbol (char with code \x1B)). Two examples are included in `ConEmu\Addons\AnsiColors16.ans` and `ConEmu\Addons\AnsiColors256.ans`.
  * Win+A - alternative buffer (toolbar button - black square). When used in Far Manager, it displays the output of the last command. Otherwise, freezes the current state of the console (incl. scroll buffer). The alternative console can be closed by a repeated Win+A or Esc.
  * Win+S - enable/disable scroll buffer (!BufferHeight). Ignored in Win7. Toolbar button - vertical arrows.
  * Win+N - Show create new console popup menu.
  * Issue 551: Updater, Invalid unpack command line, while using environment variables.
  * New !ConEmu.exe command-line options:
{{{
    /min - run minimized;
    /tsa - minimize to tray (to minimize to TSA on start, use with /min);
    /icon "<file>" - use icon from <file> (<file> can be exe, dll or ico);
    /noupdate - disable automatic update check on start.
}}}
  * 'About' dialog updated.
  * Fixed exception when lowering font size in Maximized window mode.
  * Added three system palettes: Standard VGA, Terminal.app, xterm.
  * Injects fixes.
  * Fixed incorrect size of fast configuration dialog when !ConEmu starts maximized (shortcut property).

    * Now you may use «keys» !WheelUp, !WheelDown, !WheelLeft, !WheelRight (mouse wheel).
  * Up to 32 GUI Macro may be configured and assigned to !HotKeys. By default, !CtrlWheelUp/!CtrlWheelDown will modify font height.
  * Now you can use environment variables in "`ConEmu:run:`" (Far Manager plugin). For example, you may use file association for "`*.cpp,*.hpp`" (e.g. !AltF4):
{{{
    ConEmu:Run:"%FARHOME%\Tools\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" -new_console "!\!.!"
}}}
  * Optional confirmation for closing console from !ConEmu (Features -> Confirm close console).
  * Portable: You may place files MsXml3.dll and MsXml3r.dll near to !ConEmu.exe, for eliminating xml-problems on Live (PE) and Windows 2000. I recommend to take files from Windows XP (they have less dependencies).
