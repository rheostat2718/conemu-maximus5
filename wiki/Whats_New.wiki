  * GuiMacro. Simplify passing string arguments. For example, the following commands will be equal now:
{{{
ConEmuC -GuiMacro WindowPosSize "0" "0" "800px" "600px"

  * Suggest ConEmuXml storage for new configurations by default.
  * Issue 1870: Rename dialog was shown out of screen if tabs were on bottom.


==Build 150206==
  * CP hack: Use ConEmuCpCvt to force output CP conversion. If some command uses wrong CP while converting ANSI to Unicode (the example may be perl.exe from "git add -p") set variable to correct its output. Use asterisk for all apps. This hack affects ONLY WriteConsoleW function calls.
{{{
Format:
  <exename>:<badcp>:<goodcp>[;<exename>:<badcp>:<goodcp>[...]]
Example:
  set ConEmuCpCvt=perl.exe:1252:1251;*:850:866;
}}}
  * CP hack: Use ConEmuDefaultCp to change output CP if you don't want to use chcp. If you can't use "`chcp <codepage>`" to change whole console CP output, you may change it using environment variable ConEmuDefaultCp. It will affect only WriteFile and WriteConsoleA functions. So, if you need to run several apps in one console simultaneously...
{{{
set ConEmuDefaultCp=1251
ConEmuC -fork -c App1.exe
set ConEmuDefaultCp=866
ConEmuC -fork -c App2.exe
set ConEmuDefaultCp=
}}}

  * The menu item ‘Clear history...’ was not working (the one in the `[+]` drop-down menu).
  * Sometimes ‘Console script are not supported here’ error appeared after running a task from NewConsole dialog.
  * Tasks may be organized with folders. Delimit task name from folder name with "`::`". For example, type "`Shells::PowerShell`" instead of "`PowerShell`", and so on. Only one level of folders is allowed. No need to reorder tasks of one folder continuously, folders are filled by name. Generally this was implemented for drop-down `[+]` menu.
  * Create default tasks with folders (Shells, Bash, SDK, and so on).
  * Find task by name with or without folder part (Startup page).
  * Button 'Add default tasks' will not create task duplicates (checking by task name).
  * Use self-implemented UnExpandEnvStrings while creating default tasks.
  * Allow switch '/reuse' in task parameters (alias for '/single' yet).


==Build 150203==
  * Issue 1886: Change text cursor position with ‘!LeftClick’ was not working when PSReadLine was loaded in your `$profile`. Look at `RevokeMouseInput.ps1`.
  * github#20: ‘Ctrl-Left’ and ‘Ctrl-Right’ was not working in Vim/xterm.
  * Create new console confirmation now if disabled by default. So ‘Win+W’ or ‘LClick’ on the `[+]` button creates new default task. The default task may be choosed in the ‘Tasks’ settings page. New console dialog (command, directory, as admin, and so on) may be shown with:
    * ‘Win+Shift+W’;
    * ‘Shift+LClick’, ‘RClick’ or ‘LongTap’ on the `[+]`;
    * ‘New console dialog...’ menu item (down arrow about `[+]`).
  * Window and tab closing confirmations now are disabled by default. But if there are more than a two user processes running in the console - close confirmation may be shown. So, there are thee checkboxes now:
    * Confirm window closing (unchecked);
    * Confirm tab closing (unchecked);
    * When running process was detected (checked).


==Build 150128==
  * Add missed GuiMacro GetOption description.
  * Debug. Show ConEmu build number in the `_ASSERT` dialog
  * Issue 1878: GuiMacro. Add ability to get some environment from ConEmu.

  - Returns values of some ConEmu environment variables
    GetInfo("PID") returns %ConEmuPID% and so on
    It's processed in GUI so the result may differs from RealConsole
}}}
  * Search field sometimes disappeared after playing with toolbar visibility.
  * Add small gap between search field and right window frame edge if toolbar is hidden.
  * HighlightAndGoto: Add examples with 'cmd.exe /c ...'.

After Ctrl+Click on highlighted (underlined) file
ConEmu will start cmd.exe in new tab and highlighted file will be executed.
Documents will be opened using associated application.
Add "-new_console:n" suffix to suppress "Press Enter or Esc to close console".

}}}
    * New predefined (available in list) editor command lines for Vim, SciTE, Notepad++ and Sublime.

  * Wrong startup directory used when starting at the drive root.
  * Allow rename any Far tab, not only panels.
  * Two new switches (commands actually) in ConEmuC: "-e" and "-t". Read more in wiki: http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/ConEmuC#Echo_and_Type
{{{
ConEmuC -e [-n] [-r] [-b] "string" for printing some string
ConEmuC -t [-r] [-b] "file" for printing some text file
}}}
  * Force "CHERE_INVOKING" in default tasks for cygwin.

==Build 140505==
  * Limited logging of console contents.
    * Option ‘[ConEmuHk Inject ConEmuHk]’ must be enabled to get that feature!
    * Only ‘Standard output’ will be logged (the same activity as processed with ‘ANSI X3.64’ processor). So, certain Windows console API functions will not be logged (Far Manager panels, for example).
    * You may choose folder for storing log-files, default is `"%ConEmuDir%\Logs\"`.
    * *Note!* Default folder may be write-protected, if you've installed !ConEmu to `"Program Files"`. So, you may need to choose write-enabled folder.
    * Each console will share its own log-file, example: `"ConEmu-YYYY-MM-DD-pPID.log"`.
    * So, if several processes will write to console output simultaneously, you may get unpredictable result in your log-file.
    * By default, logging is *disabled*.
  * ANSI. Fix ‘no-color’ on new line.
  * ANSI. Fix ‘bad color cell’ on EOL.
  * ANSI. Do not break `"\r\n"` in two physical writes.


==Build 140429==
  * Issue 1557: Switch `-new_console:u:"other_user:password"` may lock the account of other_user (another way). Also, bad behavior of `-cur_console` reverted (15cff21 regression)
  * Some internal changes.


==Build 140428==
  * Shield was not set on ‘Restart’ button in ‘Recreate’ dialog.
  * github`#`5: Console was not started as admin when ‘Create new console’ dialog was skipped.
  * Don't hide row/col highlight on focus loose.
  * Issue 1557: Switch `-new_console:u:"other_user:password"` may lock the account of other_user. In some cases starting new console without directly specified working directory (with `-cur_console:d:...` for example) may lock other_user account with reason ‘Bad password count exceeded’.
  * Issue 1516: !ConEmu fails to duplicate root when cmd.exe was catched as ‘Default terminal’.


==Build 140422==
  * GuiMacro. `Sleep(Milliseconds)`. Because it is processed inside GUI process, Milliseconds are limited to 10000 (10 sec) max.
  * GuiMacro. `Break()` for `Ctrl+C` and `Break(1)` for `Ctrl+Break`. However, these function may fails in some cases (in RealConsole for example). Also, they are processed by Windows asynchronously, so you may need to `Sleep(ms)` after them if your want to `print("something")` to console after.
  * Clipboard use optimization - RClick Paste may fails sometimes.
  * Fix hyperlinks underlining errors (c31f3cb regression).


==Build 140416==

==Build 140412==
  * Issue 1532: Show only critical status messages in the top-left terminal corner.
  * Issue 1534: Use About() and Settings() GuiMacro for system hotkeys (Win+Alt+A, Win+Alt+P, Win+Alt+K). System hotkeys are fixed by design. But user can use GuiMacro to open About or Settings dialogs. Moreover, if you need to open dialogs with special page activated (if you need some page often).
  * Add [ConEmuEnvironment#Export_variables ConEmuEnvironment#Export_variables] link to About dialog (Console tab).
  * Issue 1546: Mark/copy with mouse appears very slow in some cases.


==Build 140404==
  * Show 1-based console coordinates in the status bar (was 0-based).
  * Don't show size of the console visible rect by default in the status bar.
  * Win8. Failed to set console width less than 19 after Ctrl+Shift+O (in progress).

  * Ensure `Cmd_Autorun.cmd` always returns errorlevel==0.
  * Quotation marks changes in `Cmd_Autorun.cmd` (possible parenthesis issues?)
  * Use !LdrDllNotification (Win8+). Will set up hooks before !DllMain called (!LoadLibrary).
  * Ctrl+O Far macro was failed in some cases - `Shell("new_console:b")`.
  * Issue 1509: Arg parsing failed for ‘`/dir "C:\" /single`’ (01ed281 regression).
  * Allow string arguments of `-new_console` to be resetted. For example, you are running task with "/icon nice.ico" in Task parameters. You may reset it in task commands if you are running several tabs at once:
{{{
cmd -new_console:C:
powershell -new_console:C:twice.ico
}}}
  * Hook mouse_event and !SendInput API.
  * Allow "/icon" task parameter to change tab icon too.
  * Restrict "/icon" task parameter to change already started instance window icon.
  * New !ConEmu.exe switch ‘`/FontDir "YourDir"`’ allows to register fonts from several specified folders
  * Issue 1258: `Ctrl+BackSpace` delete words to the left including spaces.
    Actually, not only spaces are taken to account: ‘`>])}$.,/\"`’.
  * About dialog `-new_console` fixes.
  * No need to unset hooks if our process is to be force killed by !TerminateProcess (minor speed up).
  * Issue 1512: Warn on invalid prefix-switch in task command. Valid switches currently are
{{{
/bufferheight <lines>
/dir <workingdir>
/icon <tabicon>
/tab <tabtitle>
}}}
  * Warn on invalid switches in task parameters. Valid switches currently are
{{{
/dir <WorkingDir>

      * Windows2k, WindowsXP - all processes
      * Far Manager (far.exe, far32.exe, far64.exe)
  * Vim xterm arrow key lags happen sometimes. When Vim was switched to xterm mode, ConEmu sends corresponding xterm ESC-sequences instead of simple VK_xxx keypresses. Sometimes Vim don't catch whole sequence before any other event occures. For example, you press Right arrow and Vim does nothing before you just move mouse over console.
  * Issue 1511: Url was not detected after ‘port’: "http://example:8080/TestTest/test?test=test".
  * Issue 1516: Duplicate root failed for consoles started from !TaskMgr via Default terminal feature.
  * Consider console is to be started hidden if start X/Y==32767 (Hooks).
  * Tooltip msg fix.
  * Quake settings. Name ‘Cascade’ as ‘Centered’, enable ‘Apply’ on change.
  * New option ‘Retard inactive panes’ on Features page. There is already ‘Sleep in background’ option which retard !ConEmu window and its tabs when !ConEmu is minimized/inactive. New option ‘Retard inactive panes’, disabled by default, retard inactive but visible split-panes in the active !ConEmu window.
  * Issue 1518: Remove delay before being able interact with quake style console after slide-down.
  * Wheel was not working while !ConEmu's internal text selecting in Far.
  * Issue 823: Out of screen (upper border) selected text was not copied to clipboard.

  * Issue 1502: GuiMacro new window transparency functions.
{{{
SetOption AlphaValue <40..255>
    same as Transparency 0 <40..255>
SetOption AlphaValueInactive <0..255>
    same as Transparency 2 <0..255>
SetOption AlphaValueSeparate <0..1>
    same as Transparency 4 <0..1>
Also, new mode in Transparency for inactive value relative change
    Transparency 3 <-255..+255>
}}}
  * Show actual (active/inactive) transparency value in status bar.
  * Issue 1042: Quake, return focus to window which was active before showing !ConEmu.


==Build 140304==
  * Issue 1490: Fix crash on ANSI scrolling sequences.
  * Issue 1491: Don't erase customized directories when updating !ConEmu !PortableApps.
  * Overflow of internally registered windows messages.
  * !AnsiDbg. Send predefined `*.ans` files to srv by Ctrl+1/2/3.
  * Overwrite file confirmation in !SaveAs dialog
  * ‘Import...’ button in the Settings dialog.
    * *Note!* Export AND Import settings (xml files) now works with unnamed (.Vanilla) configuration to unify settings exchange.


==Build 140302==
  * Regression 131211. (Issue 158) !ConEmu !PanelView was not updated after panel change.
  * Internal. !AnsiDebugger added to src folder.
  * Regression 140227. "`-GuiMacro:0`" was executed in the first tab but not an active one.
  * GUI child application fails to start inside !ConEmu if ‘tab’ startup command begins with "set", "chcp", "title" (processed by ConEmuC before starting shell). Than, following GUI executable was started outside of !ConEmu window.
  * More logging of Mouse Wheel events
  * Wheel over inactive mintty pane unexpectedly scrolls active pane below too.


==Build 140227==
  * Don't unlock working directory until !ConEmu initialization finished. So, behavior of "-loadcfgfile" and "-savecfgfile" changed. If you specify xml file without path, if will be searched in the working (`ConEmu.exe` startup) directory, but not in the `ConEmu.exe` folder. 
  * In some cases Tab labels was not updated with console titles.
  * Switch "`-NoCloseConfirm`" described in the About dialog.

  * Wrong startup directory was displayed in console if startup command fails.
  * Some internal changes.


==Build 140225==
  * Log Lock/Unlock/Logoff events.
  * GuiMacro. `Keys("Combo1"[,"Combo2"[,...]])`. Combo syntax is mostly similar to !AutoHotKey syntax: `[Mod1[Mod2[Mod3]]]Key`. Where ‘Mod’ may be: `^ - LCtrl, >^ - RCtrl, ! - LAlt, >! - RAlt, + - Shift`. For example, if you want to ‘`Ctrl+/`’ post ‘`Ctrl+_`’ - use macro: `Keys("^_")`.
  * Support "`\b`", "`\xFF`" and "`\xFFFF`" in GuiMacro strings. Hexadecimal parser stops on first NON hexadecimal character. So, avoid ambiguous strings like "`\x05five`", this will be parsed as two strings "`\x05f`" and "`ive`"
  * Support more that one string argument in Paste and Print GuiMacro functions. All strings will be concatenated before pasting into console.
{{{
Syntax:
Paste (<Cmd>[,"<Text>"[,"<Text2>"[...]]])
Print("<Text>"[,"<Text2>"[...]])
Example:
print("123","\x1F","abc","def")
}}}

    * Allow multiple quoted switches in one -new_console:d:"C:\My folder":t:"My title"
    * Simple switches may be separated too: -new_console:c:b:a
    * Issue 1354: Switches will not be processed AFTER !ConEmu's executables, read more in [NewConsole#Exclusions wiki]
    * Internal refactoring (allow ‘concatenate’ or ‘apply’ them correctly) and unit tests.
  * Issue 1478: Allow !ChildGui activation with LClick.
  * Some internal changes.


==Build 140216==
  * Fix crash after resizing !ConEmu window in some cases.


==Build 140214==
  * RClick on Max caption button - Fullscreen switch.
  * Restore default split mouse hover activation timeout to 500ms.
  * Pressing Alt+F4 enexpectedly close all !ConEmu's tabs instead of active (PuTTY) only
  * Support "title" directive in Tasks and cmdline. *Note*! "title" is useless with most of shells like cmd, powershell or Far! You need to change title within your shell!
{{{
cmd /k title Your title
powershell -noexit -command "$host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle='Your title'"
}}}
  * Add ‘Tasks’ page to the ‘About’ dialog.
  * Fix caption icon in the close confirmation !TaskDialogIndirect.

  * Optional ‘Use existing !ConEmu window’ with Default terminal feature.
    * New checkbox on the ‘Default term’ Settings page
    * Optional switch "-new_console:N"
  * Far. Sometimes scrolling (buffer) was not removed after command finished.
  * Optimize loading Far plugin (!ConEmu.dll). Occasionally assertion box was appeared.
{{{
---------------------------
ConEmuC: CheckResources started
---------------------------
ConEmu ?????? [??].??: CreateFile(\\.\pipe\ConEmuPlugin????) failed, code=0x00000002, Timeout
}}}
  * Some internal changes.


==Build 140205==
  * Was not working: `"set ConEmuFakeDT=2013-11-30"`.
  * New status line cursor info format: `‘(col,row) height [V|H]’`.

==Build 140203==
  * Vim fails to react for window size change in the xterm terminal mode.


==Build 140202==
  * New ‘Intelligent selection’ mode.
    * Now, you may start both block or text selection with mouse without modifier pressed.
    * Type of selection will be determined by the direction of LButton mouse drag, when you start drag vertically - block selection, horizontally - text selection.
    * If you set up and press selection modifier - mouse selection will start even if ‘Intelligent selection’ is disabled with exceptions.
    * New mode may be disabled ‘totally’ or for specified processes only. For example, Vim knows about text selection and can process mouse internally, and Far Manager can use mouse for dragging files or text selection in Editors.
    * When "far" specified in the exceptions without extension, you can use new mode in the ‘User screen’ (panels are off) and in Viewers.
  * So, ‘Mark/Copy’ settings page redesigned
  * GuiMacro. Paste(9), Paste(10) - One-line paste with or without confirmation.
  * ‘Change prompt position with LClick’ works on left button release.
  * Some internal changes.


==Build 140128==
