A kick ass terminal is exactly what Windows needs. I'm not talking about !PowerShell, which many agree is crazy powerful, but rather the Terminal itself. We want tabs, we want control, we want better full screen, we want themes, we want more.

While I love Console2, I think I'm ready to switch as I've just been turned on a NEW contender in the Windows Console Wars. It's !ConEmu and it's insane (in a good way.) It's also actively developed.

I haven't even begun to scratch the surface as !ConEmu is one of those applications that is so configurable that you can become lost in the flexibility.

As a long-time user of Console 2, I switched to !ConEmu recently and have not looked back. This is so much better than anything that has come before it almost defies belief. Plus is is being rapidly developed (thanks Maximus!) with juicy new features appearing often enough to make it feel exciting. If you've not tried this, do it now. I have no hesitation in recommending it as the best console emulator on Windows.

!ConEmu feels like a terminal designed for those who really use the command line often.

The cusomization is targeted at the power user to produce an environment exactly the way you want, but it can feel a bit daunting to look at hundred of settings at one time.

I found out about !ConEmu from Hanselman's post. !ConEmu is the best terminal application for Windows!

Very convenient tool to run console apps. The best ever integration with Far Manager (including both stable 2.0 version and new 3.0). For those who use Far on daily basis this is MUST HAVE tool.

For those who are heavy users of consoles/terminals such as cygwin/bash, PyCmd/Console2...I just discovered this great projec... I have been using Console2 for years, its great, but conemu has so much more features, AND is its in very active development (unlike console2). I have switched already.

That masterpiece brings so much cool features to the Far manager... The most important are one window for other Far, drag'nd'drop,colors and some other less noticable but not less important features

This is an excellent addition to my suite of favourite programs. I've been lamenting the loss of a powerful, beautiful terminal since moving to windows for work reasons. Getting to know powershell introduced powerful, and now, !ConEmu gives me beautiful as well! :) Hotkeyed quake-style dropdown with custom background, multiple tabs, stay on top and partial transparency on lose focus. I am bursting with geeky glee.

!ConEmu is my favorite free !PowerShell tool. It is a generic multi-console host so you can add as many console-based applications like !PowerShell to it.
