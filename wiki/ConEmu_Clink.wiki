=!ConEmu and clink==
Build 120716 introduces new experimental feature on «Features» page: «Use Clink in prompt». Clink - bash style completion.

*Note* Clink version 0.2 is recommended. But, unfortunately its binaries was not released by the author yet. You may [https://code.google.com/p/clink/#Building_clink build clink] yourself from its [https://code.google.com/p/clink/source/checkout sources].

  * This is *experimental* feature, it may be changed or removed in future builds.
  * Download here version 0.1.1: http://clink.googlecode.com
  * Unpack here: `%ConEmuBaseDir%\clink` (this folder already created by !ConEmu installer and contains `Readme.txt`)
  * Please note, clink archive contains subfolder. Files `clink_dll_x86.dll` and `clink_dll_x64.dll` must be located in `%ConEmuBaseDir%\clink`.
  * Restart !ConEmu and ensure that «Use Clink in prompt» is checked on «Features» page.

OK, now bash style completion will be available in `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`.

Note. Clink will be called in shell prompt (cmd/powershell) if `ConEmuHk.dll` or `ConEmuHk64.dll`
is loaded into shell process. This will be done for «root» processes (that you specify when creating
console) or when «Inject !ConEmuHk» option is checked on «Features» page (this is required, if you
start second-level cmd/powershell from root process, e.g. `cmd /c cmd /k …`).
