=!ConEmu and clink==
Build 121015 introduces new experimental feature on ‘Features’ page: ‘Use Clink in prompt’. Clink - bash style completion.

*Note* Clink version *0.2.1* or later is *recommended*. 
If clink binaries are not available, you may [https://code.google.com/p/clink/#Building_clink build clink]
yourself from its [https://code.google.com/p/clink/source/checkout sources].

  * This is *experimental* feature, it may be changed or removed in future builds.
  * Download clink version 0.2: http://clink.googlecode.com
  * Unpack here: `%ConEmuBaseDir%\clink` (this folder already created by !ConEmu installer and contains `Readme.txt`)
  * Please note, clink archive contains subfolder. Files `clink_dll_x86.dll`, `clink_dll_x64.dll` (and others) must be located in `%ConEmuBaseDir%\clink`.
  * Turn on checkbox ‘Use Clink in prompt’ on ‘Features’ page, save settings and restart !ConEmu.

OK, now bash style completion will be available in `cmd.exe`.

Note. Clink will be called in shell prompt (cmd) if `ConEmuHk.dll` or `ConEmuHk64.dll`
is loaded into shell process. This will be done for ‘root’ processes (that you specify when creating
console) or when ‘Inject !ConEmuHk’ option is checked on ‘Features’ page (this is required, if you
start second-level cmd from root process, e.g. `cmd /c cmd /k …`).
