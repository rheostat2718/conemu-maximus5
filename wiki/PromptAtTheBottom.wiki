Do you want to get your cmd.exe prompt bottom aligned? On ConEmu startup and after "cls"?

==Far Manager==
Actually, I can't understand why anyone use cmd as shell but not a FarManager.
It's a fast handy and powerfull combination of:

  * command prompt (you may run any console or GUI application from its prompt, any %COMSPEC% commands, can be integrated with powershell);
  * two pane file manager (copy/move files, create directories and hard links, browse remote hosts, and so on); you have no need in file manager? are you sure you are working on your PC?
  * powerful and fast editor with syntax highlighting;
  * dozens of miscellaneous plugins for anyone taste and purpose;

Try it! [http://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en Download] and install into !ConEmu's folder
(put far.exe near to !ConEmu.exe) and run it.
If you don't need panels on startup (really?) - press *Ctrl+O*, *Ctrl+B* and save configuration changes *Shift+F9*.
You will get command prompt with permanent history (Alt+F8).


==Plain cmd.exe==
OK. If you still want use plain "cmd.exe" - here is one trick using [http://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html AnsiEscapeCodes].
