}}}
    * New predefined (available in list) editor command lines for Vim, SciTE, Notepad++ and Sublime.
    * Prefix ‘#’ means ‘run editor outside of !ConEmu tab’.

==Build 140505==
  * Limited logging of console contents.
    * Option ‘[ConEmuHk Inject ConEmuHk]’ must be enabled to get that feature!
    * Only ‘Standard output’ will be logged (the same activity as processed with ‘ANSI X3.64’ processor). So, certain Windows console API functions will not be logged (Far Manager panels, for example).
    * You may choose folder for storing log-files, default is `"%ConEmuDir%\Logs\"`.
    * *Note!* Default folder may be write-protected, if you've installed !ConEmu to `"Program Files"`. So, you may need to choose write-enabled folder.
    * Each console will share its own log-file, example: `"ConEmu-YYYY-MM-DD-pPID.log"`.
    * So, if several processes will write to console output simultaneously, you may get unpredictable result in your log-file.
    * By default, logging is *disabled*.
  * ANSI. Fix ‘no-color’ on new line.
  * ANSI. Fix ‘bad color cell’ on EOL.
  * ANSI. Do not break `"\r\n"` in two physical writes.


==Build 140429==
  * Issue 1557: Switch `-new_console:u:"other_user:password"` may lock the account of other_user (another way). Also, bad behavior of `-cur_console` reverted (15cff21 regression)

==Build 140428==
  * Shield was not set on ‘Restart’ button in ‘Recreate’ dialog.
  * github`#`5: Console was not started as admin when ‘Create new console’ dialog was skipped.
  * Don't hide row/col highlight on focus loose.
  * Issue 1557: Switch `-new_console:u:"other_user:password"` may lock the account of other_user. In some cases starting new console without directly specified working directory (with `-cur_console:d:...` for example) may lock other_user account with reason ‘Bad password count exceeded’.
  * Issue 1516: !ConEmu fails to duplicate root when cmd.exe was catched as ‘Default terminal’.


==Build 140422==
  * GuiMacro. `Sleep(Milliseconds)`. Because it is processed inside GUI process, Milliseconds are limited to 10000 (10 sec) max.
  * GuiMacro. `Break()` for `Ctrl+C` and `Break(1)` for `Ctrl+Break`. However, these function may fails in some cases (in RealConsole for example). Also, they are processed by Windows asynchronously, so you may need to `Sleep(ms)` after them if your want to `print("something")` to console after.
  * Clipboard use optimization - RClick Paste may fails sometimes.
  * Fix hyperlinks underlining errors (c31f3cb regression).


==Build 140416==
  * Don't use hooks inside shell started from mintty (6b514d0 regression).
  * Issue 1553: Mouse button actions modifier was not saved (vkCTSVkAct).
  * Issue 1556: Ctrl+L not working in cygwin.


==Build 140414==
  * Issue 1544: Cygwin ssh forking fails.


==Build 140412==
  * Issue 1532: Show only critical status messages in the top-left terminal corner.
  * Issue 1534: Use About() and Settings() GuiMacro for system hotkeys (Win+Alt+A, Win+Alt+P, Win+Alt+K). System hotkeys are fixed by design. But user can use GuiMacro to open About or Settings dialogs. Moreover, if you need to open dialogs with special page activated (if you need some page often).
  * Add [ConEmuEnvironment#Export_variables ConEmuEnvironment#Export_variables] link to About dialog (Console tab).
  * Issue 1546: Mark/copy with mouse appears very slow in some cases.


==Build 140404==
  * Show 1-based console coordinates in the status bar (was 0-based).
  * Don't show size of the console visible rect by default in the status bar.

{{{
cmd -new_console:C:
powershell -new_console:C:twice.ico
}}}
  * Hook mouse_event and !SendInput API.

      * Windows2k, WindowsXP - all processes
      * Far Manager (far.exe, far32.exe, far64.exe)
  * Vim xterm arrow key lags happen sometimes. When Vim was switched to xterm mode, ConEmu sends corresponding xterm ESC-sequences instead of simple VK_xxx keypresses. Sometimes Vim don't catch whole sequence before any other event occures. For example, you press Right arrow and Vim does nothing before you just move mouse over console.

  * Overflow of internally registered windows messages.
  * !AnsiDbg. Send predefined `*.ans` files to srv by Ctrl+1/2/3.
  * Overwrite file confirmation in !SaveAs dialog
  * ‘Import...’ button in the Settings dialog.
    * *Note!* Export AND Import settings (xml files) now works with unnamed (.Vanilla) configuration to unify settings exchange.


==Build 140302==
  * Regression 131211. (Issue 158) !ConEmu !PanelView was not updated after panel change.
  * Internal. !AnsiDebugger added to src folder.
  * Regression 140227. "`-GuiMacro:0`" was executed in the first tab but not an active one.

  * More logging of Mouse Wheel events
  * Wheel over inactive mintty pane unexpectedly scrolls active pane below too.


==Build 140227==
  * Don't unlock working directory until !ConEmu initialization finished. So, behavior of "-loadcfgfile" and "-savecfgfile" changed. If you specify xml file without path, if will be searched in the working (`ConEmu.exe` startup) directory, but not in the `ConEmu.exe` folder.

==Build 140225==
  * Log Lock/Unlock/Logoff events.
  * GuiMacro. `Keys("Combo1"[,"Combo2"[,...]])`. Combo syntax is mostly similar to !AutoHotKey syntax: `[Mod1[Mod2[Mod3]]]Key`. Where ‘Mod’ may be: `^ - LCtrl, >^ - RCtrl, ! - LAlt, >! - RAlt, + - Shift`. For example, if you want to ‘`Ctrl+/`’ post ‘`Ctrl+_`’ - use macro: `Keys("^_")`.
  * Support "`\b`", "`\xFF`" and "`\xFFFF`" in GuiMacro strings. Hexadecimal parser stops on first NON hexadecimal character. So, avoid ambiguous strings like "`\x05five`", this will be parsed as two strings "`\x05f`" and "`ive`"
  * Support more that one string argument in Paste and Print GuiMacro functions. All strings will be concatenated before pasting into console.
{{{
Syntax:
Paste (<Cmd>[,"<Text>"[,"<Text2>"[...]]])
Print("<Text>"[,"<Text2>"[...]])
Example:
print("123","\x1F","abc","def")

    * Internal refactoring (allow ‘concatenate’ or ‘apply’ them correctly) and unit tests.
  * Issue 1478: Allow !ChildGui activation with LClick.
  * Some internal changes.

powershell -noexit -command "$host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle='Your title'"
}}}

    * Optional switch "-new_console:N"
  * Far. Sometimes scrolling (buffer) was not removed after command finished.
  * Optimize loading Far plugin (!ConEmu.dll). Occasionally assertion box was appeared.
{{{
---------------------------
ConEmuC: CheckResources started
---------------------------
ConEmu ?????? [??].??: CreateFile(\\.\pipe\ConEmuPlugin????) failed, code=0x00000002, Timeout
}}}
  * Some internal changes.

==Build 140203==
  * Vim fails to react for window size change in the xterm terminal mode.


==Build 140202==
  * New ‘Intelligent selection’ mode.
    * Now, you may start both block or text selection with mouse without modifier pressed.
    * Type of selection will be determined by the direction of LButton mouse drag, when you start drag vertically - block selection, horizontally - text selection.
    * If you set up and press selection modifier - mouse selection will start even if ‘Intelligent selection’ is disabled with exceptions.
    * New mode may be disabled ‘totally’ or for specified processes only. For example, Vim knows about text selection and can process mouse internally, and Far Manager can use mouse for dragging files or text selection in Editors.
    * When "far" specified in the exceptions without extension, you can use new mode in the ‘User screen’ (panels are off) and in Viewers.
  * So, ‘Mark/Copy’ settings page redesigned
