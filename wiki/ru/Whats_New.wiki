==Build 121216==
  * Issue 846: New predefined color palette `<Solarized>`.
  * Sometimes console was not resized after maximizing !ConEmu window. TechInfo: because of larget font size in *real console*. Auto-reducing automatically when possible.
  * Sometimes close console confirmation «Press Enter or Esc to close console» was bypassed.
  * Cursor setting page was redesigned. Inactive cursor may be fully configured now. To be continued, some combinations not works yet.
  * New settings page «Task bar». Some controls from «Appearance» page are here now.
  * New option «Auto hide !ConEmu after last console close». Must be used together with «Leave !ConEmu after last console close».
  * New `ConEmu.exe` switches:
    * `/MinTSA` - almost like combination of «/Min /TSA» but implies «Leave ...» and «Auto hide after last console close».
    * `/SetDefTerm` - forces installation of !ConEmu as default terminal. May be useful with «/MinTSA /Detached».
  * Now you can turn on «Register on OS startup» for «Default terminal» feature. «Integration» page.


==Build 121211==
  * Issue 824: Ctrl+!BackSpace deletes word leftward to the cursor. Ignored in Far Manager. Hotkey is configurable. ATM takes care of «Change prompt with Left Click» third state.
  * Issue 707: !ConEmu Inside: WinXP: Trying to show «Tip pane» automatically and close it after !ConEmu exits.
  * Issue 838: New cursor type «Block». With «Color» checked !ConEmu draws «empty» rectangle around cell under cursor.

==Build 121124==
  * Experimental! !ConEmu may set up itself as default terminal for console applications.
    * Warning! This feature may raise false alarms in some antiviral programs!
    * Warning! Autoupdate with 7z package may fails if this feature is enabled!
    * Settings -> Integration -> Force !ConEmu...
    * Note! In the current build active !ConEmu window required for processing interception.
    * TechInfo: When enabling this feature ConEmu calls CreateRemoteThread for injecting !ConEmuHk.dll into selected processes (explorer.exe by default). This allows to intercept CreateProcess WinAPI function and replace it with !ConEmu.exe...
    * There is new !ConEmu.exe switch "/nodefterm" - don't start initialization procedure.
  * Issue 825: ANSI X3.64 sequences don't works with Gow ls.
  * Issue 819: Regressions in hooks (build 121028).
  * Options «Skip click on activation» applies to the click on the inactive split-pane.

  * New item in tab popup menu: Terminate -> Active group. Also available from System menu -> Active console.
  * New hotkey (unassigned by default) for close of active group.


==Build 121118==
  * For debug purposes. User may define environment variable `"ConEmuReportExe"`. !ConEmuHk (when it is injected in the process with defined name) will show message box. It is right moment to take memory dump of this infiltrated process. For example (for cmd.exe command prompt):
{{{
    set ConEmuReportExe=sh.exe
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\sh.exe" --login -i
}}}
  * Issue 811: Unable to change Highlight & goto shortcut.
  * When «Don't close !ConEmu on last console close» is on it was impossible to close empty !ConEmu window.

  * Issue 818: More DBCS console bugfixes.


==Build 121109==
  * Быстрый доступ к вкладке «Keys & Macro» (hotkeys) страницы настроек. Win+Alt+K или SystemMenu -> Help -> Hotkeys.
  * Новые hotkeys: Win+Alt+Del - закрыть активный таб (сделано для редакторов/вьюверов в Far), Win+F4 - закрыть !ConEmu (same as «Cross» click).
  * При закрытии таба через Win7 taskbar thumbnail - подтверждение закрытия не появлялось на экране.
  * Новый пункт «Duplicate root...» в меню таба. Пытается создать копию таба с корневым процессом в той же директории и с тем же окружением. Можно назначить хоткей.


==Build 121108==
  * Settings: Настройки «Automatic attach of cmd ...» перемещены на вкладку «ComSpec».
  * Новые переменные окружения: "ConEmuDrawHWND" and "ConEmuBackHWND".
  * Переменые окружения ("ConEmuHWND", "ConEmuDrawHWND", "ConEmuBackHWND") обрабатываются перед запуском новой консоли. Ниже пример запуска gvim (команда для cmd запущенного в !ConEmu):
{{{
gvim --windowid !ConEmuBackHWND! -new_console:sH
}}}


==Build 121106==
  * Новый ключ ConEmuC: Экспорт переменых окружения в родительские процессы. Формат (регистроНЕзависимо):
{{{
ConEmuC /export[=CON|ALL] [Var1 [Var2 [...]]]
  VarN        - имя переменной, в середине/конце можно указать '*' (вроде масок).
  /export     - копировать переменные в процессы текущей консоли и ConEmu GUI
  /export=CON - копировать переменные только в процессы текущей консоли
  /export=ALL - копировать переменные в процессы всех табов и ConEmu GUI
}}}
    * Внимание! «Inject !ConEmuHk» должна быть включена для установки переменных.
    * Некоторые шеллы могут игнорировать изменение переменных.
    * «Far Manager» & «TCC/LE» - OK; «cmd» - частично (
    нужно что-нибудь запустить в открытом ранее cmd.exe, хотя бы "cmd /k exit", чтобы переменные «применились»;
    bash - не работает (похоже, что он полностью игнорирует смену переменных «снаружи»).
  * При «Hide caption» и «Frame width» >= ширины «resizable» рамки - рамка не скрывается и ее можно ресайзить мышкой.


==Build 121104==
  * Issue 786: Failed to input Chinese in PuTTY.
  * Resize bugfix: when maximizing scrolling window (e.g. "dir c:\ /s") «viewport» enlarges after delay.


==Build 121101==
  * Искать текст теперь можно по всему буферу (а не только по видимой области). Флажок «Freeze console» требуется включить. To be continued...
  * В некоторых случаях !DosBox не стартовал из командной строки Far (doom.exe -warp 10).
  * Background: можно задать «сплошной цвет» а не только файл картинки. Введите в поле «Path» значение цвета !ColorRef (напимер «#300A24» без кавычек). Поддерживаемые форматы: «#RRGGBB» (hex), «0xBBGGRR» (hex), «xBBGGRR» (hex), «RRR,GGG,BBB» (dec), «RRR GGG BBB» (dec).
  * Новая цветовая схема: <Ubuntu>. Если хотите получить «фиолетовый» фон - установите цвет #300A24 в качестве фоновой картинки на вкладке «Main».
  * Умолчание для хоткея «Minimize/Restore» заменено на `Ctrl+~`.
  * Issue 795: Ошибка смены размера окна при Hide/Restore.


==Build 121029==
  * Новая опция: Settings -> Status bar -> System colors (отрисовка статусной строки с использованием стандартных цветов Windows).
  * Issue 791: Откат предыдущих изменений «Run As Administrator».
  * Issue 700: Принудительная установка бОльшего количества буферов истории команд. Лечим следующий «глюк» консоли: при запуске дерева процессов (например «cmd -> Far -> ConEmuC -> cmd -> vim -> cmd -> ...») при малом количестве буферов (всего 4 по умолчанию) перестает работать Up arrow в строке ввода. Меняем здесь `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console\ConEmu`: History buffer size - min=16, default=50; Count - min=16, default=32.
  * В меню задач /Tasks popup menu/ (Win+N or down arrow near to `[+]`) теперь можно щелкнуть RClick по задаче для вызова подменю с содержимым задачи. Здесь можно выбрать конкретную команду для запуска нового таба, если не нужно запускать весь список.
  * Issue 794: При переименовании таба новое имя отражается на панели задач.


==Build 121028==
  * Issue 526: Оптимизация «Inject !ConEmuHk». Должно быть значительное ускорение и, надеюсь, без новых багов.
  * (Выполнен откат) Попытка смены способа запуска «Run As Administrator» для избежания мелькания RealConsole при загрузке.
  * Исправлены встроенные макросы для Far Manager / Lua (Far 3 build 2851).
  * Правка "-new_console": иногда вместе с ключом убирались нужные пробелы.
  * Команда «sudo» в стиле `*`nix. В поставку включен файл "%!ConEmuBaseDir%\csudo.cmd". Если флажок «Add %!ConEmuBaseDir% to %PATH%» включен (вкладка «!ComSpec»), то в non-elevated командной строке можно набрать csudo для запуска с повышенными привилегиями, например:
{{{
csudo dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFX3 /All /Source:D:\sources\sxs /LimitAccess
}}}
  * Некоторые правки закрытия окна !ConEmu.


==Build 121022==
  * Новые горячие клавишы (теперь для мышки): Ctrl+RClick - system menu, Shift+RClick - active tab menu.
  * New GuiMacro.
{{{
Menu(<Type>) - pop up System (Type=0) or Tab (Type=1) menu.
}}}
  * Now you may use LButton, RButton, MButton in "Keys & Macro". Note. When you use Alt+Btn for Menu() - release Alt before Btn to avoid menu cancelling.
  * Added default support of GIT-bash directory structure, read [ConEmuFolders#MinGW_structure MinGW structure] for details.
  * Hiew32 fails to paste more than 1 char at once.

Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Maximus7792/ConEmu User:Maximus7792/ConEmu] in progress. Any comments, suggestions or corrections?


==Build 120830==
  * Internal changes in child windows.
  * Some fixes for DBCS.
  * GuiMacro. Changes in Shell function. All following examples runs "cmd" in new tab: «`Shell("new_console","cmd")`» or «`Shell("","cmd")`» or «`Shell("","","cmd")`». *Memorial*. Other verbs, like «`Shell("open","cmd")`» runs "cmd" outside of !ConEmu window.
  * Safe Far close. From current build, this option may be used for «Unsafe» console closing. Type "`#Close(1,1)`" (without quotas) in Safe Far close macro field and turn on checkbox. Now, click on the cross-button in !ConEmu title provokes «Terminate active process» in all opened consoles, regardless of «Far» it is or not. *Warning!* Use on your own responsibility, this method may damage console applications data!
  * Far Manager & [TabletPC TabletPC]. Tap on clock+1row (upper-right corner) show/hide panels.

  * !CmdAutoAttach failed, if !ConEmu.exe not installed.
  * «Show was hidden warning» option on «Features» page. «On» by default. May be turned «Off» for use with some desktop switchers (Dexpot e.g.).
  * Issue 674: Tab macro function going to console doesn't handle 1-based offsets properly.

    Shell. You may omit both <File> and <Parms>. This means «Duplicate tab».
      Shell("new_console:sV") - create same tab, split current tab to bottom;
      Shell("new_console:sH") - create same tab, split current tab to right.
}}}

  * Minimal console size now is 4 cols 2 lines.


==Build 120802==
  * Experimental: `-new_console:s[<SplitTab>T][<Percents>](H|V)`. Примеры.
    * `cmd -new_console:s` - split current tab, new tab and old (current) tab become 50% width of current tab.
    * `cmd -new_console:s50H` - same as `cmd -new_console:s`.
    * `cmd -new_console:sV` - split current tab, create new tab to the bottom.
    * `cmd -new_console:s3T30H` - split 3-d tab, create new tab to the right with 30% width.
  * Regression, Build 120727a: xterm-256 was broken.

  * !Cmd_Autorun.cmd fixed.
  * ConEmuC switches. "`/IsConEmu`", "`/IsTerm`", "`/IsAnsi`". `ErrorLevel 1` - ON, `ErrorLevel 2` - OFF.
  * Issue 633: Cannot specifiy environment variables for startup dir.
  * Mark & Copy.
    * !DoubleClick, !TripleClick fixes.

    * Group «Automatic attach of cmd...» provide install (or view) command, which command processor (cmd/tcc) will execute on startup. This allows to attach new console (cmd/tcc) into new !ConEmu tab.


==Build 120705==
  * Settings tree redesigned.

    * Создать mini-dump: `ConEmuC.exe /DEBUGPID=<PID> /MINI`
    * Создать full-dump: `ConEmuC.exe /DEBUGPID=<PID> /FULL`
    * О соответствии битности беспокоиться не нужно, все сделает сам ConEmuC.exe.
    * Также, добавлен пункт в системном меню !ConEmu: Debug -> Active process memory dump.

  * Немного AI в «Change prompt text cursor position with Left Click» - не пытаться вывести курсор за пределы строки.
  * Issue 575: Confirm or abort setting !ConEmu !OnTop from external program.


==Build 120630==
  * Page «Transparency», «Use separate value».
  * После закрытия консоли (не последней) на статусной строке не обновлялось поле «!ActiveCon/!TotalCount».
  * !ConEmu inside mode.

    * Адаптировано для Vista.
  * More ANSI examples. !RenameTab.cmd, !SetConTitle.cmd, !SetProgress.cmd.

    Type=1: set progress value to <Value> (0-100).
    Type=2: set error state in progress.
}}}
  * На ярлык !ConEmu (или сам !ConEmu.exe в проводнике) можно набросить один или несколько ярлыков программ. Каждая запустится в своей вкладке. Исключение - если в в настройке !ConEmu «Startup» -> «Command line» указан "`far.exe`". В этом случае строка запуска «подклеивается» к "`far.exe`".
  * При быстром закрытии !ConEmu «крестиком» в консоли успевало мелькнуть «Press Enter or Esc to close console...».
  * Issue 575: Confirm or abort setting !ConEmu !OnTop from external program.
  * Issue 624: Menu was not available in Notepad++ with !SourceCookifier plugin.

==Build 120625==
  * Новая опция 'Min cursor size (pix)' на вкладках 'Text cursor' & 'App distinct'.
  * Issue 619: В не которых случаях возникал Assertion после закрытия Far Manager.
  * Немного поправим 'Detect text line ends', 'Trim trailing spaces', 'Bash margin'.
  * Новый ключик для !ConEmu.exe - "`/inside`". Пример использования в "`ConEmu\Addons\ConEmu_Inside.reg`". Смысл - создать панель в проводнике и запустить в ней, например, powershell. Пока «на поиграться», вроде работает в Windows 7 и Windows 8, в других системах не проверял. Перед вызовом контекстного меню в проводнике нужно либо увеличить высоту нижней области (Windows 7), либо показать панель информации/просмотра (Windows 7 & 8).


==Build 120624==
  * На вкладке 'Mark & Paste' опция 'Auto copy' переименована в 'Copy on LButton up'. По умолчанию включена.

  * Теперь могут быть изменены комбинации: Apps+Space, Alt+F9, Alt+Enter, Alt+Space, Ctrl+Up, Ctrl+Down, Ctrl+!PgUp, Ctrl+!PgDn и !PicView.!SlideShow.
  * Соответственно, убраны флажки из 'Send to console': Alt+F9, Alt+Enter, Alt+Space.
  * Win+Down не увеличивал размер консоли (опция «Win+Arrows - resize window»).
  * Issue 606: На Windows XP не появлялось сообщение (тултип) об ошибках в области нотификаций (TSA).
  * Настройки текстового курсора перенесены на новую отдельную вкладку 'Text cursor'.
  * Issue 612: Option to change cursor size ('Fixed cursor size' & '(5-100) %').
  * Issue 608: Проблемы с telnet.
  * cmd/powershell/tcc: Параметр "-new_console" (для запуска консольных приложений в новом табе) теперь можно использовать в prompt без "ConEmuC.exe". Например, в cmd prompt можно ввести:
{{{
powershell -new_console
}}}
  * Исправлен Detach GUI приложений.
  * Issue 607: 'Mark & Paste' and 'App distinct' -> 'Detect text line ends', 'Bash margin', 'Trim trailing spaces', 'EOL'.
  * 'Mark & Paste' and 'App distinct' -> 'Change prompt text cursor position with Left Click'.


==Build 120618==
  * Issue 582: Позиционирование текстового курсора кликом мышки в prompt (cmd, powershell, tcc/le, ...)


==Build 120617a==
  * Задержка при активации !ConEmu с открытым Far 3.
  * В Putty не проходили события от колеса мышки.
  * В 120617 поломался аттач GUI приложений.


==Build 120617==
  * 'Quake style slide down' third state - auto hide on lose focus.
  * Не перехватывать фокус при запуске, если запускаемся с ключом "/min".
  * Issue 599: 'Auto copy' on 'Mark & Paste' - copy selected text immediately on left mouse button up (when selecting with mouse).
  * Issue 599, Issue 570: Small lags removed, when pastings long text from clipboard.
  * 'Main' settings page redesigned.
  * Chinese (DBCS) improvments.
  * Some Wine related fixes, but still not working ;)
  * При невозможности зарегистрировать глобальный хоткей (Minimize/Restore) выдается сообщение в области уведомлений.
  * Умолчание для Minimize/Restore - Win+Shift+C.


==Build 120614==
  * Для фоновой картинки добавлены опции !DownLeft и !DownRight.
  * Issue 577: Chinese font display error on Chinese Win XP.
  * Issue 587: Right click gives an error box.


==Build 120613==
  * При удалении задачи, назначенной в Startup, !ConEmu переставал запускаться.
  * 120612: При выполнении команды с "-new_console" !ConEmu минимизировался.
  * Меню таба (Rename tab) и Apps+R - переименовать активный таб. Для Far - пока можно переименовать только «Панели».
  * Для фоновой картинки добавлена опция !UpRight.
  * Issue 590: Изменена обработка Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break.
  * Some Quake style improvements.


==Build 120612==
  * В поставку добавлен пример «!ColorPrompt.cmd». Запустите его в cmd.exe или tcc.exe для смены цвета текста command prompt на желтый.
  * Новые аргументы для !ConEmu.exe - /!ShowHide и /ShowHideTSA. Если !ConEmu не запущено - запускает (с возможно указанным /cmd ...), если окно !ConEmu уже открыто - сворачивает его или прячет в TSA. Действие похоже на глобально регистрируемый хоткей (Win+C), но этот хоткей не сработает, если !ConEmu не был запущен. А с ключами - можно настроить ярлык на рабочем столе.
  * Аргумент !ConEmu.exe: /dir "Folder". Аналог Working folder, задаваемый в свойствах ярлыка.
  * Параметр «Quake style slide down» на вкладке «Features». Пример настройки в «!ConEmu\!ConEmu_Tilde.xml». Если вы хотите что-то типа [http://tech-bytes.co.uk/2008/05/23/a-quake-style-console-for-your-gnome-desktop/ этого] - переименуйте «ConEmu_Tilde.xml» в «!ConEmu.xml», при загрузке компьютера запустите !ConEmu с ключом /min, и вы получите «выезжающую» консоль по тильде.
  * Issue 576: Trap when updating Jump Lists/Task while history is empty.
  * Не работал Copy из альтернативной консоли (Win+A).
  * Issue 584: App distinct color palette not working.
  * Issue 576: !ConEmu.exe /updatejumplist.
  * When Maximized, check/uncheck «Hide caption always» losed caption.
  * !GuiMacro.
{{{
    Paste(2[,"<Text>"]) - paste all lines, without confirmations
    Paste(3[,"<Text>"]) - paste first line, without confirmations
    Task(Index[,"Dir"]) - start task with 1-based index
    Task("Name"[,"Dir"]) - start task with specified name
}}}
  * В диалоге настроек для !GuiMacro (вкладка Keys) работают "\\", "\r", "\n", "\t". Теперь можно задать что-то вроде «Paste(2,"exit\n")» для выхода из cmd.exe


==120611==
  * [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ConEmuTheWindowsTerminalConsolePromptWeveBeenWaitingFor.aspx Статья] в блоге Scott Hanselman :)


==Build 120609==
  * Коррекция Injects для Windows 8 RC.
  * Issue 571: В диалоге подтверждения создания консоли добавлен флажок «New window». Если указывается «Another user», то под выбранным аккаунтом запускается сам !ConEmu.exe! При желании, можно назначить отдельный хоткей для открытия диалога с включенным флажком.
  * В некоторых случаях по краям консоли оставался мусор.
  * Уточнение снятия скриншотов (режимы Maximized/Fullscreen).
  * Не работал Attach GUI приложений.
  * При перемещении мышкой бегунка полосы прокрутки - не обновлялось положение курсора.


==Long time ago?==
Lifehacker published the article about Console, PowerCmd, Take Command and Mintty. Unfortunately, ConEmu again was not mentioned :(
All my tries to post comment and mail to article author was ignored :(
http://lifehacker.com/5857540/the-best-terminal-emulator-for-windows

  * На вкладке «Mark & Paste» добавлено ком.строка запуска внешнего редактора, значение по умолчанию: `far.exe /e%1:%2 "%3"`. '%1' - row, '%2' column, '%3' - filename.
  * Уточнение снятия скриншотов (Win+H). Добавлен Win+Shift+H - скриншот экрана.
  * Issue 570: Pasting into iPython (in fact, any console app except Far) does not work as expected.
  * Issue 558: Some more color anomalies.

==Build 120604==
  * Error «Can't free hooks in module ...» в !ConEmuHk.dll
  * Issue 557: Assertion в !RealBuffer.cpp
  * Issue 568: При первом вызове 'View console output' (в плагине Far) вьювер переключался в dump-режим
  * В некоторых случаях после завершения консольной команды в Far возникал exception


==Build 120603==
  * Internal interprocess communication changes.
  * Status bar. Добавлена колонка 'ConEmu GUI PID'.
  * Issue 566: Hotkey `<<None>>` is not unique.
  * На вкладке 'Tasks' окна 'Settings' добавлено поле 'ConEmu arguments for Jump list'. Здесь можно указать доп.параметры для запуска с панели задач (Tasks, Jump list). Например: /icon "cmd.exe"


==Build 120602==
  * Internal interprocess communication changes.
  * Windows 7 и выше. Поддержка Jump list, в секцию 'Tasks' !ConEmu может добавить свои 'Predefined tasks' и команды из истории. Наполнение Jump list занимает некоторое время, поэтому на вкладке 'Tasks' добавлена кнопка 'Update Now!'.
  * !ConEmu.exe: параметр /title "Template". В заголовке окна будет отображаться фиксированный текст, а не заголовок активной консоли. В "Template" можно использовать переменные окружения.
  * Диалог 'Create new console': в системном меню добавлен пункт 'Reset command history...'.
  * Win+H: Make screenshot of active !ConEmu window.
  * Tabs: Раздельные шаблоны для панелей (Far) и других консольных приложений.
  * Tabs: Для консольных приложений (кроме Far) можно настроить список слов, исключаемых из заголовка. Надоел префикс 'Administrator:' при запуске консоли 'под админом' в Win7.
  * Убираем задержки закрытия !ConEmu.
  * В некоторых случаях не появлялись Shell-диалоги (при запуске файлов, выборе пунктов контекстного EMenu).
  * Minor change in (isMonitorConsoleLang == 2).
  * На Status bar тоже действует 'Fade when inactive'.
  * В историю не попадала команда, указанная через '/cmd' при запуске !ConEmu.exe.
  * Issue 561: В некоторых случаях !ConEmuHk64.dll вызывала падение консольного приложения.
  * Issue 564: События мыши не посылались в консоль при отключенном флажке 'Inject !ConEmuHk'.
  * Изменения подтверждения закрытия табов. При закрытии ConEmu 'крестиком' запрос отображается один раз (на все консоли).


==Build 120527a==
  * Не сохранялись изменения режима окна (Normal/Maximized/Full screen), если перед 'Save settings' не была нажата 'Apply'.
  * Некорректные подсказки для пунктов меню настройки Status bar.


==Build 120527==
  * В системном меню и меню для таба отображаются текущие горячие клавиши.
  * Мышиные события не попадали в консольные приложения (кроме Far) при включенной прокрутке.
  * 'Settings' -> 'Features' -> 'Mouse options' -> 'Enable mouse'. По умолчанию включено. Можно отключить - запретить посылку в консоль событий от мышки. При этом остается возможность использовать мышь для пометки и вставки текста. Опция живет уже давно, но в интерфейсе отсутствовала.
  * Добавлена новая опция прозрачности - !ColorKey. Но для Far все-таки удобнее использовать '!UserScreen transparency'.
  * Win+G - новый хоткей для пункта системного меню 'Attach...'.
  * Status Bar. По умолчанию включен. Настройка шрифта, цветов и колонок (любой набор из доступных 20-и) в 'Settings' -> 'Status bar'. Отключить/включить колонки можно также из контекстного меню строки статуса, открывающегося правой кнопкой мышки. Описание колонок отображается при наведении на них мышки. Некоторые колонки обрабатывают left click:
    * поля 'CAPS'/'NUM'/'SCRL' - переключение.
    * поле 'Active VCon' - меню выбора консоли (аналогично меню с тулбара).
    * поле 'Transparency' - меню настройки прозрачности (100%..40%, !UserScreen, !ColorKey); при наведении мышки на пункты меню 90%..40% - прозрачность главного окна сразу изменяется.


==Build 120524a==
  * ConEmuC.exe/!ConEmuC64.exe sets console text attributes to 7 on startup.
  * 'Settings' -> 'Mark & Paste' -> 'Freeze console before selection'.
  * 'Find test' -> 'Freeze console'.
  * Lags in !ConEmu plugin.


==120524==
  * Создана страничка на [http://www.facebook.com/ConEmu.Maximus5 Facebook].


==Build 120523a==
  * Issue 554: Исправлена обработка `^[#G` (ANSI X3.64).


==Build 120523==
  * Из системного меню убран пункт 'Auto scroll'. Если нужно поставить консоль 'на паузу' - Win+A (альтернативный буфер).
  * Ctrl+Win+Alt+Enter - принудительная активация !ConEmu в !FullScreen. Как и Win+C, настраиваемый хоткей срабатывает из любого приложения.
  * Win+Shift+Del - Terminate активного процесса текущей консоли.
  * Добавлена переменная окружения "ConEmuANSI". Принимает значения "ON" или "OFF".
  * Issue 554: Ошибки позиционирования курсора и вывода текста (ANSI X3.64).
  * Issue 553: Откат прокрутки консоли.


==Build 120522==
  * Новая опция «[AnsiEscapeCodes ANSI X3.64 / 256color]» на вкладке «Features». Адресуется консоль целиком (с прокруткой), но Xterm 256color влияет только на «рабочую» область (нижняя часть консоли, если есть прокрутка). Чтобы работало - должен быть включен «Inject !ConEmuHk». Если кажется, что 256color не работает - включить флажок «Colorer !TrueMod support», проверить выключен ли буфер/прокрутка. Например: "`256colors2.pl -cur_console:h0`". Или прокрутить консоль в самый низ: "`echo ^[[9999;1H`" (перед использованием «^[» нужно заменить на ESC код (символ с кодом \x1B)). Два примера: `ConEmu\Addons\AnsiColors16.ans` и `ConEmu\Addons\AnsiColors256.ans`.
  * Win+A - альтернативный буфер, кнопка на тулбаре - черный квадратик. При выполнении в Far Manager - показывает вывод последней команды. Иначе - замораживает текущее состояние всех консоли (весь буфер, с прокруткой). Закрыть альтернативную консоль - повторным Win+A или Esc.
  * Win+S - включение/отключение прокрутки (!BufferHeight). Игнорируется в Win7. Кнопка на тулбаре - вертикальные стрелки.
  * Win+N - Show create new console popup menu.
  * Issue 551: Updater, Команда распаковки формировалась неправильно при использовании переменных окружения.
  * Новые ключи !ConEmu.exe
{{{
    /min - запустить свернутым;
    /tsa - сворачивать в TSA (чтобы свернуть в TSA при запуске используйте вместе с /min);
    /icon "<file>" - откуда брать иконку, <file> может быть exe, dll или ico;
    /noupdate - отключить автоматическую проверку обновления при старте.
}}}
  * Обновлен диалог 'About'.
  * Исключение при уменьшении размера шрифта в Maximized режиме.
  * Добавлены три системных палитры: Standard VGA, Terminal.app, xterm.
  * Правки в Injects.
  * Диалог Fast configuration отображался размернутым на весь экран, если !ConEmu был запущен с ярлыка, в свойствах которого указано Maximized.
  * Исправлена некорректная отрисовка при включении флажка 'Auto' на вкладке 'Main' в Maximized режиме.
  * Minor changes in ConEmuC.exe.


==120520==
  * ConEmu is mentioned in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_managers#cite_ref-20


==Build 120515==
  * В предыдущей сборке отвалилась загрузка 'App distinct'.
  * Максимальное количество поддерживаемых консолей увеличено до 30-и (дальше кнопки лень рисовать).
  * На тулбаре отображается 'кнопка' только для активной консоли, а не для всех открытых (как раньше). При клике на кнопку - отображается меню выбора запущенных консолей/табов.
  * Активация с клавиатуры - цифрами.
    * Win+F11 и Win+F12 больше не занимаются активацией консолей.
    * Если консолей меньше 11-и, все как раньше.
    * Если больше - то допускаются однокнопочные и двухкнопочные активации. Например:
    * «Win(down) 1 5» - активирует 15-ю консоль;
    * «Win(down) 1 Win(up)» - активирует 1-ю консоль.
  * Еще раз 'Sleep in background' bugfix. 
  * Issue 541: В режиме эскизов некорректно выделяются файлы правой кнопкой мыши.


==Build 120514==
  * Issue 543, Issue 544: Правим баги несчастливой версии :)
  * Issue 56: При драге поверх окна !ConEmu больше не забирается фокус.
  * Drag&Drop: При дропе файлов в ком.строку Far - отображается контекстное меню (Paste/Goto/Edit/View).
  * Drag&Drop: Internal changes in overlay image.


==Build 120513==
  * 'Ignore console cursor size' вместо неработавшей 'Ignore telnet cursor size'. Также добавлена в 'App distinct'.
  * Не работала опция 'Send Alt+Space to console' (вкладка 'Keys').
  * В диалоге создания новой консоли при запуске группы (Tasks) игнорировался флажок 'Run as adminstrator'.
  * Issue 532: Опция 'Show TSA balloon' (влияет только на автоматический режим проверки).
  * Issue 537: Проверяем опцию !WinRar: [HKCU\Software\WinRAR\Extraction\Profile] "!UnpToSubfolders"
  * Issue 538: Неверные иконки в Thumbnails/Tiles в корне архивов.
  * Issue 539: Некорректная отрисовка Thumbnails/Tiles поверх панели QView (Ctrl+Q) или Info (Ctrl+L).
  * Разрешен Shell Drop файлов в редактор и диалоги. Drop, естественно, в виде вставки текста (имен/путей перетаскиваемых файлов).
  * Еще раз 'Sleep in background' bugfix. 
  * Настройка 'Command line' переехала на новую вкладку 'Startup' окна 'Settings'.
  * В меню (кнопка [+] на тулбаре) добавлены пункты 'New console dialog' и 'Setup tasks'.


==Build 120510==
  * !ConEmu блокировал Clipboard при вставке (Shift+Ins, Ctrl+V).
  * Пример макроса: ConEmu\Far1_reg\TabList.reg
  * !AnsiCon вызывал падение в cmd/tcc.


==Build 120509a==
  * Issue 534: !ConEmuSetup: Строка с путем по умолчанию для 64 битной версии выводится сразу после 32 битной.
  * Поиск текста в консоли. Hotkey Apps+F или Edit -> Find text.
  * Telnet and 'Sleep in background' bugfix.


==Build 120508==
  * Issue 65: Для корректной работы приложений, использующих !SetConsoleActiveScreenBuffer (telnet.exe и т.п.) требуется включить флажок «Inject !ConEmuHk».
  * Чтобы в корне не маячили и не мешали фару при работе вне !ConEmu - !ExtendedConsole пененесен в подпапку.
  * Полностью переделана обработка !HotKeys.
    * Понятия «!HostKey» больше нет.
    * Для всех (почти) клавиш можно назначить собственный модификатор.
    * Исключение - системные комбинации, активация консоли по номеру (общий модификатор) и управление размером окна (общий модификатор).
    * Теперь можно использовать «клавиши» !WheelUp, !WheelDown, !WheelLeft, !WheelRight (колесо мышки).
  * Теперь можно настроить до 32-х GUI Macro, привязав их к !HotKeys. По умолчанию, !CtrlWheelUp/!CtrlWheelDown меняет размер шрифта.
  * В префиксе "`ConEmu:run:`" теперь можно использовать переменные окружения. Например, для файлов "`*.cpp,*.hpp`" настроить такую ассоциацию (e.g. !AltF4):
{{{
    ConEmu:Run:"%FARHOME%\Tools\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" -new_console "!\!.!"
}}}
  * Опциональное подтверждение закрытия консоли из !ConEmu (Features -> Confirm close console).
  * Portable: Рядом с !ConEmu.exe можно положить файлы MsXml3.dll и MsXml3r.dll чтобы не возникало проблем с xml-конфигурацией в Live сборках и в Win2k. Регистрировать MsXml3.dll не нужно. Рекомендуется брать файлы MsXml3.dll и MsXml3r.dll из Windows XP (в них меньше зависимостей).
  * Немного доработано пересоздание консоли.
  * Не срабатывал Shift для пунктов меню 'Restart', 'Restart as', 'New console'.
  * Меню (системное или для таба) всегда всплывает при RClick на табах.
  * GUI Apps in tabs: теперь работает пункт меню 'Attach...'
  * GUI Macro: `Tab(<Cmd>[,<Parm>])`
{{{
    <Cmd>=0 - show/hide tabs
    <Cmd>=1 - commit lazy changes
    <Cmd>=2 - switch next (eq. CtrlTab)
    <Cmd>=3 - switch prev (eq. CtrlShiftTab)
    <Cmd>=4 - switch tab direct (no recent mode), Parm=(1,-1)
    <Cmd>=5 - switch tab recent, Parm=(1,-1)
    <Cmd>=6 - switch console direct (no recent mode), Parm=(1,-1)
    <Cmd>=7 - activate console by number, Parm=(1-based console index)
    <Cmd>=8 - show tabs list menu (indiffirent Far/Not Far)
}}}
  * GUI Macro: `Paste(<Cmd>[,"<Text>"])`
{{{
    <Cmd>=0 - paste all lines, <Cmd>=1 - paste first line
    When <Text> is omitted - paste from Windows clipboard, otherwise - paste specified text.
}}}
  * Keyboard: 'Show opened tabs list (does not work in Far - use macro instead)'. Default - F12.
  * !ConEmu plugin: команда в меню плагина - 'Show all tabs list', макрос 'ConEmu.TabList.fml'
  * Issue 530: Ошибка в цветах Thumbnails/Tiles при включенном «Optional marking character».
  * Вкладка настроек 'Text selection' переименована в 'Mark & Paste'.
  * Для консольных приложений (кроме Far) !ConEmu теперь может самостоятельно обрабатывать вставку текста из буфера обмена. По умолчанию, Ctrl+V вставляет первую строку содержимого буфера, а Shift+Ins вставляет текст полностью (генерируя нажатия <Enter> для перевода строк). Можно настроить подтверждение вставки многострочного текста (при вставке нескольких строк из буфера в ком.строку cmd.exe нажатия <Enter> могут привести к нежелательному исполнению команд). Можно настроить подтверждение вставки длинного текста (по умолчанию 200 символов).
  * На вкладках 'Mark & Paste' и 'App distinct' добавлена настройка вставки из буфера обмена.
  * В 64-битных OS при запуске в новой вкладке "cmd" учитывается настройка битности желаемого !ComSpec.
  * Меню таба отображается по Apps+Space (раньше было Win+Apps).


==Build 120422==
  * Issue 527: Правим ошибки в детекторе панелей.
  * Глюк размера при старте, если 'Hide caption' и режим 'Maximized' в ярлыке.
  * При нажатии кнопки 'Apply' в окне настроек в полях размера окна появлялись старые значения.
  * Не работали кнопки +/-/Up/Down на вкладке 'App distinct'.


==Build 120421==
  * *Внимание*. Изменения в использовании командных процессоров.
  * В настройку добавлена вкладка '!ComSpec'. Туда перенесны настройки 'Long console output'.
  * На вкладке '!ComSpec' добавлена настройка используемого командного процессора. По умолчанию настроен автоматический выбор между tcc.exe (если установлен) и cmd.exe. Также есть возможность принудительного задания 'битности' командного процессора в 64-битных OS. По умолчанию битность процессора совпадает с битностью OS.
  * Опция 'Leave on close' вынесена в интерфейс на вкладку 'Tabs'.


==Build 120418==
  * Гиперссылка на редактор/строку не работала из консоли с прокруткой.
  * Убираем задержки из выполнятора.


==Build 120417==
  * Issue 511: Теперь bdf-шрифты можно использовать и для рамок.
  * Issue 523: Невозможность начать пометку текста из меню при прокрученном вверх буфере.


==Build 120416==
  * Некоторые настройки (палитра, Cursor, Extend Fonts) можно настраивать раздельно по приложениям и признаку Elevated. Настройка на странице 'App distinct' окна 'Settings'. Приложения сохраняются в настройке (reg/xml) в подключе "Apps".


==Build 120414==
  * При открытии диалога настроек не включался флажок 'Long console output'.
  * Ошибка в возврате Plugin.Call("4b675d80-1d4a-4ea9-8436-fdc23f2fc14b","...") для Far3.
  * После Far3 build 2576 поломались макросы использующие $Text. В частности, отвалился 'длинный правый клик'.
  * GUI Apps in tabs: "Notepad" in Win-W don't works.
  * Убрана небольшая задержка переключения табов (редактор/вьювер) через интерфейс !ConEmu.
  * Issue 516: При минимизации кликом по таскбару не отключались Win-Number.
  * Issue 518: Если Far 'не отвечал', то при попытке обращения к нему (переключение табов, и т.п.) !ConEmu на некоторое время зависал.
  * Issue 521: Пропадание табов редактора/вьера.
  * Issue 248: Добавлена возможность сохранять/загружать пользовательские палитры цветов. В палитру входят 32 цвета (16+16) и настройки 'Extend foreground colors'. Именованые палитры сохраняются в настройке (reg/xml) в подключе "Colors".
  * Issue 445: Добавлена возможность создавать пользовательские 'Задачи'/'Tasks'. Задача - это алиас для запуска одного или более приложений в новых вкладках !ConEmu. Настройка на странице 'Tasks' окна 'Settings'. Задачи сохраняются в настройке (reg/xml) в подключе "Tasks". Их можно использовать (на примере задачи {Shells}):
    * при запуске, указав в свойствах ярлыка: "!ConEmu.exe /cmd {Shells}";
    * указав {Shells} в поле 'Command line' страницы 'Main' окна 'Settings';
    * при создании новой консоли через интерфейс !ConEmu (`+` на тулбаре, список в Recreate-диалоге);
    * из командной строки cmd.exe: "%!ConEmuBaseDir%\ConEmuC.exe" /c {Shells} -new_console.
    * из командной строки far.exe: conemu:run:{Shells} -new_console
  * Minor fix in debug switch "/detached".
  * Vista+: При детаче в консоли устанавливается приемлемый для пользователя размер шрифта.


==120408==
  * !ConEmu was mentioned on http://jpsoft.com/blogs/2012/04/windows-console-replacements-part-6-take-command-and-conemu/


==Build 120401==
  * Settings->Far Manager->!KeyBar RClick: при подсветке пункта меню на кейбаре отображается выполняемое действие.
  * Issue 514: Доработана опция 'Extend foreground colors with background'. Работает для любого приложения, а не только для Far Manager. Например, для Far Manager, в качестве 'заменяемого цвета фона' можно выбрать цвет панелей (синий по умолчанию), тогда для Far получится как бы своя собственная палитра цветов. Или наоборот, можно настроить цвета для внешнего редактора (Vim), выбрав в качестве цвета расширения его цвет фона. Для Far Manager имеет смысл только для веток 1.7x и 2.x. Для ветки 3.x любые !TrueColor цвета можно настроить через интерфейс Far Manager.
  * Issue 319: !Hyperlinks. Разрешено для любого приложения (не только в Far). Но для открытия редактора (LClick по ошибке из консоли с cmd.exe) Far должен быть запущен. При наведении меняется курсор мышки.


==Build 120327==
  * Far3: после выполнения макроса !ShiftEnter курсор прыгал к ".."
  * Hyperlink detector (e-mails).
  * Issue 505: Reattach fixed.
  * Settings->Far Manager->KeyBar RClick: Правый клик по кейбару отображает меню модификаторов. Т.е. щелкнув правой кнопкой по "7Search" в редакторе откроется всплывающее меню, в котором можно выбрать любой F7 с модификатором, например Ctrl-F7.
    Примечание. При выборе пункта меню в консоль посылается именно нажатие, т.е. если на Ctrl-F7 висит макрос - будет выполнен макрос.


==Build 120326==
  * Far3 build 2573.
  * Еще раз табы для модальных окон (Far3).


==Build 120325==
  * Текущая версия НЕ совместима с Far3 build 2567 и выше (пока).
  * Еще раз табы для модальных окон (Far3).
  * Issue 507: В некоторых случаях при запуске консольных приложений не отключались расширенные атрибуты символов (color/italic/...).
  * Issue 509: В некоторых случаях (смена режима дисплея) в консоли мог самопроизвольно включаться режим прокрутки.
  * Issue 510: Отключен AI приводивший к невозможности сохранить заданную пользователем высоту шрифта (сохранялась высота, с которой был создан реальный шрифт).
  * Issue 511: Rudimentary BDF support (from thecybershadow).
  * Не работали жесты в release сборке.
  * Touchpad & Touchscreen: после двойного тапа в консоль мог проваливаться 'лишний' LBtnClick.
  * Добавлен макрос Editor.MsRClick.fml - удобен для работы в редакторе и диалогах  на Touchpad & Touchscreen.
  * В режимах 'Hide caption...' & Maximized 'светилась' рамка окна.


==Build 120315==
  * Far3 build 2546.
  * Исправлено отображение табов для Far3.
  * Продолжение 'гиперссылок'. Теперь обрабатываются и URL & e-mail (открытие через !ShellExecute).
  * Issue 499: В архив 7z добавлена 64битная версия GUI, соответственно снято ограничение на обновление 64битной версии только инсталлятором.


==Build 120314==
  * Far3 build 2545, рекомендуется bis-сборка.
  * Не работали жесты в release сборке.
  * Еще раз детектор 'гиперссылок' на ошибки компиляции (добавлена поддержка Delphi/FPC).


==Build 120304==
  * Немного поправлен детектор 'гиперссылок' на ошибки компиляции.
  * Убираем !OutputDebugString.


==Build 120227==
  * Правки межпроцессного взаимодействия.
  * Ошибка в умолчаниях шаблонов табов для вьювера и редактора с изменениями.
  * Vista и выше. При невозможности изменить размер консоли из-за пределов по размеру консольного шрифта, !ConEmu пытается увеличить/уменьшить размер шрифта в консоли. Для пользователя это 'прозрачно', шрифт в окне !ConEmu не меняется.
  * Windows 7 и выше. Поддержка тачскринов и жестов.
    * Длинный тап - аналог длинного RClick, открытие EMenu.
    * Перетаскивание одним пальцем - аналог перетаскивания с нажатой левой кнопкой мышки (например, для Drag&Drop).
    * Тап двумя пальцами - аналог короткого RClick, выделение файла. Позиция - центр между пальцами.
    * Нажатие и тап (опустить первый палец, тап вторым пальцем, отпустить первый палец) - аналог короткого RClick, выделение файла. Позиция - первый палец.
    * Поворот (опустить первый палец, крутить вторым пальцем вокруг первого, отпустить первый палец) - переключение табов, по часовой стрелке - !CtrlTab, против часовой стрелки - !CtrlShiftTab. Активация таба - после отпускания первого пальца.
    * Прокрутка (опустить два пальца, двигать их вверх/вниз, отпустить пальцы) - аналог прокрутки колесом мышки (инверсно).
    * Зум (опустить два пальца, сблизить/раздвинуть, отпустить пальцы) - изменить размер шрифта в ConEmu.
  * Issue 493: При включении табов размер консоли не меняется - увеличивается высота окна !ConEmu.
  * Issue 494: Hotkeys for starts text and block selection from keyboard.
  * Issue 495: Option for send 'Alt-F9' to console.
  * Issue 496: Edit -> Mark text doesn't start selection sometimes.
  * Опять работаем в Win2k.


==Build 120215==
  * Experimental: Внутренние изменения межпроцессного взаимодействия.
  * Installer. Подхватывается путь установки Far 3.x, в том числе и для компонентов «Far Manager plugins» и «Far3 !ExtendedConsole».
  * Правки в injects.
  * Issue 296: Исправлена работа в режиме !HideCaption & Maximized.
  * Префикс плагина "ConEmu:run:" теперь поддерживает и "-new_console" для убирания мерцания панелей.
  * Доработаны макросы для Far3.
  * В заголовке таба с консольным выводом (макрос Far на CtrlO) отображается 'Console output' вместо имени временного файла.
  * Для 'Resize panels by mouse' добавлен флажок 'use both panel edges'.
  * Issue 491: ConEmu changes window size on F3 or F4 in Far.
  * Win+Apps - active tab popup menu.
  * Продолжение GUI-приложений во вкладках.


==Build 120205==
  * EMenu по правому клику (опция '!RightClick 4 EMenu') всегда отображается в позиции курсора мыши.
  * Откат поддержки injects в UPX модулях.


==Build 120204==
  * Issue 485: Проблема при запуске с включенным Desktop mode.
  * Issue 489: Не работает dism (правки в injects).


==Build 120203==
  * Продолжение GUI-приложений во вкладках. Теперь при запуске консольной утилиты/команды из GUI-приложения во вкладке - утилита/команда стартует в новой вкладке !ConEmu.
  * Issue 486: После запуска новой вкладки в фоне - не обновлялись кнопки на тулбаре.


==Build 120201==
  * !AutoUpdate. Сообщение о невозможности обновления 64битной версии GUI показываем только при ручном вызове.
  * Не работал Terminate (из меню) для активного процесса.
  * Issue 484: Не восстанавливается иконка в трее после краха проводника.
  * В меню для активной консоли (таба) вместо 'Terminate' отображается 'Terminate->Console' и 'Terminate->Active process'.


==Build 120129a==
  * Issue 479: Tiles/Thumbnails не обновлялись в Far 2.x при открытом QSearch.
  * Issue 482: !RightClick и EMenu на границе панели.


==Build 120129==
  * Продолжение GUI приложений во вкладках.
  * Правки в injects.
  * Настройки выделения текста и скрытия заголовка перенесены из в доп.диалогов в окно 'Settings'.
  * Far 3 build 2426 (не работал !ConEmu Panel Views).
  * Issue 481: !ConEmu.120118 — ошибка переключения табов кликами.


==Build 120118==
  * Issue 337: Attach не-фаровских консолей: System menu -> Attach to... Проверялось в Windows 7. *ТехИнфо*. Для аттача необходимо загрузить в выбранный процесс модуль !ConEmuHk.dll (!ConEmuHk64.dll), что выполняется посредством !CreateRemoteThread. В принципе, некоторые антивирусы могут ругаться при попытке использования этой функции. Вызывается !CreateRemoteThread из ConEmuC.exe (ConEmuC64.exe).
  * Issue 480: Answering "Detach console" with "no" still detaches console.
  * В 120115 для Far 3.x отвалился правый клик на keybar.
  * Консольным программа разрешено 'рисовать' в DC !ConEmu функцией StretchDIBits (Far плагины !ImageView и !PicViewAdv). *ТехИнфо*. Из отрисовки в !ConEmu исключается прямоугольник, указанный в последнем вызове StretchDIBits. Его отрисовка восстанавливается при изменении размеров окна или при изменении текста в консоли в этом прямоугольнике.
  * Еще немного по пропорциональным шрифтам.
    

==Build 120115a==
  * Параметр "`-cur_console[:n]`" можно указать после "`ConEmu.exe /cmd`" чтобы отключить 'Press Enter or Esc to close console'. Пример для !UserMenu в Far 3.x, открывает файл под курсором в hiew, запущенном в новом экземпляре !ConEmu.
{{{
macro:post $If (Apanel.Folder || Apanel.Plugin && !!(APanel.OPIFlags & 0x20)) msgbox("Warning!!","Panel or current item type disallows Hiew execution",0) $Else print(@"conemu.exe /config hiew /cmd T:\Utils\Files\Hiew32\hiew32.exe -cur_console:n ") CtrlF Enter $End
}}}

  * Правки детектора панелей.
  * Отладочная опция: System menu -> Debug -> Load screen dump.
  * Windows 7: Overlay icon 'Shield' on taskbar for elevated tabs.
  * Far 3 build 2381: Исправим безобразие с !RightClick :) при включенных 'Right selection fix' и '!RightClick 4 EMenu'.
  * При ошибках запуска корневой команды ConEmuC.exe отображает текущую директорию (Can't create process, !ErrCode, Current directory, Command to be executed).
  * Issue 477: 'Ломка' шрифта в диалоговых окнах.
  * Issue 478: Отображение рамок с растровыми шрифтами при отключенном 'Fix Far borders'.


==Build 120110==
  * Зарегистрирован аккаунт в твиттере :) http://twitter.com/ConEmuMaximus5
  * Автообновление: описано в FAQ-!ConEmu.txt

  * Не работало отключение флажка 'Long console output'.
  * При запуске команд из Far Manager можно использовать параметр "`-cur_console:h[N]`". "`h[N]`" аналогичен параметру в "`-new_console`" но команда будет запущена в текущей а не новой консоли.
  * Issue 474: !ConEmu not accepting mouse wheel input when mouse coords are negative.
  * Issue 476: New checkbox 'Settings'->'Tabs'->'Far windows'.


==Build 120105c==
  * Issue 295: Улучшена отрисовка диалогов при использовании пропорциональных шрифтов.
  * !AutoUpdate. Перед запуском обновления (после закрытия окна !ConEmu) выполняется проверка отсутствия других запущенных экземпляров !ConEmu.


==Build 120105==
  * Issue 461: В некоторых случаях !ConEmu падал при закрытии GUI приложения во вкладке.
  * Issue 469: YAC (Yet Another Completion) doesn't work. Для !GetConsoleWindow (возвращающего окно отрисовки) !GetClassName перехватывается и возвращает "!ConsoleWindowClass".
  * Issue 472: Падение при выборе меню дисков (Alt+F1).
  * При отрисовке !TrueColor через !ExtendedConsole.dll сбивался цвет фона пробельных символов при совпадении с 'цветом текста'.
  * Все !HotKeys теперь можно задать на вкладке 'Keys' окна настроек. Настройка клавиш с вкладки 'Tabs' убрана. На вкладке 'Tabs' добавлен флажок '«Host-key»+Number iterates Far windows'.


==Build 120102==
  * На главной странице проекта ( http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/ ) добавлена кнопочка '+1'. Щелкните, кому не жалко :) Ну, и тут ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/ ) тоже.
  * Far3 build 2311 (build 2343 supported).
  * Issue 102: !AutoUpdate. Умеем обновляться как через инсталлятор, так и через 7z-архив. Для обновления через архив - нужен архиватор (7z или !WinRar).
  * При запуске в новой конфигурации вместо нескольких диалогов отображается один общий диалог 'быстрой настройки'.
  * Параметр '-new_console' не запускал во вкладке GUI приложения.
  * В системное меню добавлены пункты 'Visit home page' и 'Report a bug' (Win+Alt+Space или клик по иконке в заголовке !ConEmu).
  * Еще немного FAQ-!ConEmu.txt
  * Issue 465, Issue 466: Правки в !ConEmuHk.
  * Часть настроек с вкладки 'Features' перенесена в новую 'Far Manager'.
  * На вкладке настроек 'Far Manager' добавлены поля для макросов. Вернуть макрос 'по умолчанию' можно очистив поле макроса.
  * Issue 468: System's «Copy File» window (by Ctrl+V) appears behind !ConEmu.
  * При запуске !ConEmu.exe выполняется проверка наличия необходимых файлов (ConEmuC.exe и т.п.)
