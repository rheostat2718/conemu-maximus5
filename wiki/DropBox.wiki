Googlecode has strong limits for attachments in the Issues.
That's why you can't upload large files (crash dumps etc.) to your Issue and need to use
on of hundreds of free file hosters.

=!DropBox (my choice)=
Free [http://db.tt/9myALvii registration] and free space: 2.0 GB + 500 MB (my invite link) + 500 MB (installing app to your mobile).
Upload file to !DropBox (even from your browser) and post link to the Issue.

I like using !DropBox app on my Android device, it allows creating shortcuts to specific folder just on launcher screen.
