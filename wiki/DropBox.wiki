Googlecode has strong limits for attachments in the Issues.
Moreover, total space for *all* attachments in *all* issues is limited too.
I need to contact Google support team to increase issues quota each time when it goes out :(

That's why you can't (strongly not recommended) upload large files (crash dumps etc.) to your Issue
and need to use on of dozens of free file hosters. Some links below...

=Cloud services=

==!DropBox (my choice)==
Free [http://db.tt/9myALvii registration] and free space: 2.0 GB + 500 MB (my invite link) + 500 MB (installing app to your mobile).
Upload file to !DropBox (even from your browser) and post link to the Issue.

I like using !DropBox app on my Android device, it allows creating shortcuts to specific folder just on launcher screen.

==Yandex==
Another russian free cloud service [https://disk.yandex.ru/invite/?hash=VZANG8NO Yandex disk] gives you up to 10 GB free space.

==!SkyDrive==
Free cloud service from [https://skydrive.live.com/ Microsoft] gives you 7 GB for free.


=Simple file hosters=

==Sendspace==
[http://www.sendspace.com/ Sendspace] allows you to upload files up to 300 MB without registration.

==rghost.ru==
[http://rghost.ru/ RGhost] (russian) allows you to upload files up to 500 MB without registration.
