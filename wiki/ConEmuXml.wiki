#summary ConEmu.xml, how to send your config to developer

As [https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/Settings#Where_settings_are_stored wiki] said,
ConEmu settings may be stored in the ‘Windows Registry’ and in the xml files (`ConEmu.xml` usually).

When one reports about problem, developer needs your ConEmu settings often.

The easiest (and may be most proper) way to provide it is ‘Export...’ button in the
[https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/Settings#Settings_dialog ConEmu Settings dialog].

Save your config in the new xml (*don't overwrite your existing config*) file and attach it to the created issue.
