#summary unicode support

!ConEmu is unicode application. That means if your console application (cmd, java, perl, powershell and so on)
can write unicode characters to the console, !ConEmu will show them.

So if you observe some non-ascii characters are not displayed correctly you may check the following:


==Check if the font used in !ConEmu has proper glyphs==
===What font you are using===
[SettingsMain Main] settings page has two section: ‘Main console font’ and ‘Change pseudographics font’.

‘Pseudographics font’ is used for some unicode ranges generally containing frames and some pseudographics symbols.
For example: `═ ║ ╒ ╓ ╔ ╕ ╖ ╗ ╘ ╙ ╚ ╛ ╜ ╝ ╞ ╟`.
The default range is U2013..U25C4. You may change it within ConEmuXml:
{{{
<value name="FixFarBordersRanges" type="string" data="2013-25C4;"/>
}}}
Actually, you may untick the ‘Change pseudographics font’ if you do not need it.

‘Main console’ font is used for all other symbols.

There is ‘Font charset’ there. Usually it must contain ‘Default’ or ‘ANSI’.
This setting is not related to UTF-8 or Unicode itself, it just tells to Windows
what font it must choose it there are several fonts in one family. But
you may play with this option and see how the result is changed.

One more strange thing: the option ‘Treat font height as device units’
reflects on created font too.

===Check font glyphs===
Check if the font has proper glyphs: run from `Win+R` the `charmap.exe` tool and examine your font.


==Check if RealConsole is capable to accept unicode==
Press ‘Ctrl+Win+Alt+Space’ to reveal RealConsole and check its contents.
Actually, it may fails for hieroglyphs and some others unicode ranges.

Anyway, the critical thing is that RealConsole has TrueType font selected
in the console properties.

This font may be configured from [SettingsFeatures Features] -> button `...` on the right of ‘Show real console’<br>

==Check if your console application is Unicode-aware==
What shell or application is responsible for your broken output? In most cases you will see
the active application exe name in the StatusBar. If it does not support unicode output
you need to check for updates of this application. For example, MSYS1 is not unicode-aware.

Well, in some cases the following trick may help: set console codepage to UTF-8
before running your shell or application. For example, put the following in the startup task.
{{{
chcp 65001 & cmd
}}}

==Also !ConEmu provide some tests you may run==

{{{
ConEmuC -CheckUnicode
}}}

{{{
cmd /c "%ConEmuBaseDir%\Addons\utf-8-test.cmd"
}}}
