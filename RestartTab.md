Restart console dialog may be called with hotkey (default **Win**+**~**, you may choose any on ‘Keys & Macro’ page)
or from tab popup menu.

Also, you may restart console without comfirmation dialog from tab popup menu: ‘Restart’ and ‘Restart as Admin’ menu items.

This feature allows to reuse root command, for example restart your project compilation (on some build errors)
or close (‘Terminate’ button in Restart dialog) active console.
