Usage
=====
1. Unpack distribution contents to %FARHOME% directory.
2. Copy Loader.dll (Loader64.dll using Far3 x64) to the directory,
   containing Far2 plugin binary (i.e. where colorer.dll located).
3. (optionally) Rename Far2 plugin binary (i.e. colorer.dll -> colorer.dl_).
4. (optionally) Rename Loader.dll to more obvious name (i.e. colorer3.dll).
5. (optionally) Create wrapper ini-file. It must match exactly with wrapper
   file name, renamed on step 3 (i.e. colorer3.ini). If you don't create
   ini-file, wrapper will create it for you with unique GUIDs.
   !!!WARNING!!! When you create ini-files manually, you must create
   unique GUIDs in each ini wrapper file.

Sample wrapper ini files are included in distribution.

Q. How to generate unique GUID?
A. i.e. C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Bin\Uuidgen.Exe

TechInfo
========
Far3Wrap.dll (or Far3Wrap64.dll using Far3 x64) may be located in:
1) directory with Loader.dll (Loader64.dll using Far3 x64)
2) directory, defined by "Far3WrapperPath" environment variable
3) "%FARHOME%\Plugins"
4) "%FARHOME%"

When wrapper ini file was not created yet, Loader.dll try to
locate Far2 plugin in it's own directory.
Wrapper try to find *.dll and *.dl_ files, which
HAVE SetStartupInfoW and DON'T HAVE GetGlobalInfoW.
So, if Far2 plugin does not export SetStartupInfoW you must
create wrapper ini file manually!
