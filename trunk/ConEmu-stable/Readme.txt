This is «Stable» version of ConEmu.

Please, don't think that «Stable» is «totally bug-free»,
in the ConEmu project some builds are marked as «Stable»
when they are ready (in my opinion) for public.

But! Bugfixes, patches, features will not be applied to
«Stable» builds until next «Stable» comes!

On the other hand, that means that «Stable» builds will
not contains breaking changes, side by side with bugfixes
and new features.
