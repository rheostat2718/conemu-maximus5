ActiveProcess in most cases is the latest process run in the console.
That is your shell (cmd, powershell, bash) if you are in the prompt,
and current console tool during some command execution (perl, git, ssh, etc.)

**Note** ‘Active Process’ is **console** process or ChildGui application, but not a `ConEmu[64].exe` or `ConEmuC[64].exe`.
