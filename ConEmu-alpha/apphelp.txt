In his process, user32.dll was pulled in as a dependency of aclayers.dll,
which was explicitly loaded by apphelp.dll, the Windows appcompat shim
engine. Typically apphelp is loaded when you have compat flags on a binary.
I was able to reproduce the assert by setting the Windows Vista mode flag
on the exe. But on Ben's machine, apphelp gets loaded even without any
flags, we suspect because of EMET.
