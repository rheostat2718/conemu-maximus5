#summary What is an Apps key?

This key (mentioned as `VK_APPS` in `WinUser.h`) located
between **RightWin** and **RightShift** on most
[keyboard layouts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Klawiatura_maszynistki.jpg).

Sometimes it's called **Application/Menu**. Thought, it is not correct in Windows
because `VK_MENU` (from `WinUser.h`) refers to the **Alt** key in fact.
