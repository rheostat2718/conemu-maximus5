How to use PictureView in FAR 1.7x started under ConEmu

1. Download original plugin from: http://forum.farmanager.com/download/file.php?id=875
2. Unpack it to %FARHOME%\Plugins\PictureView
3. Rename file "0PictureView.dll" to "0PictureView.dl_"
4. Rename file "PicViewWrapper.dll" to "0PictureView.dll"
5. Enjoy

PS. Some comments about original plugin.
a) GFL interface requires libgfl267.dll. You may, on yours head, try to use other GFL
   versions (3.11 for example) by renaming libgfl311.dll to libgfl267.dll. This file
   must be placed in the plugin folder, or anywhere in %PATH% folders.
b) ACDSee interface does not works with *.apl version higher than 5.0.67.0.
