ConEmu is distributed as msi package ‘`ConEmuSetup.*.exe`’, or archive named ‘`ConEmuPack.*.7z`’.
Both of them contains x86 (aka x32) and x64 versions of all ConEmu binaries.

Also, the archive and the installer contains both x86 and x64 versions of ConEmu FAR plugins
(‘`Plugins\ConEmu\ConEmu.dll`’ and ‘`Plugins\ConEmu\ConEmu.x64.dll`’ for example).

So, You can simply unpack downloaded archive or install ConEmu to the
[Far Manager](http://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en) folder
or any other folder, if you are not using Far Manager..

**PS**. In fact, it does not matter which version of GUI you use (ConEmu.exe or ConEmu64.exe).
ConEmu automatically selects the required files (ConEmuHk.dll or ConEmuHk64.dll and so on)
to work with choosen console or GUI application.
